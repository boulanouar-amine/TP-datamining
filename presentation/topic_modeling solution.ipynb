       "       'given the rectilinear domain $\\\\mathcal{p}$ of $h$ pairwise-disjoint rectilinear obstacles with the total of $n$ vertices inside a plane, we study a problem of computing bicriteria rectilinear shortest paths between two points $s$ and $t$ inside $\\\\mathcal{p}$. three types of bicriteria rectilinear paths are considered: minimum-link shortest paths, shortest minimum-link paths, and minimum-cost paths where a cost of the path was the non-decreasing function of both a number of edges and a length of a path. a one-point and two-point path queries are also considered. algorithms considering these problems have been given previously. our contributions are threefold. first, we find the critical error inside all previous algorithms. second, we correct a error inside the not-so-trivial way. third, we further improve a algorithms so that they are even faster than a previous (incorrect) algorithms when $h$ was relatively small. considering example, considering a minimum-link shortest paths, we obtain a following results. our algorithm computes the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path inside $o(n+h\\\\log^{3/2} h)$ time. considering a one-point queries, we build the data structure of size $o(n+ h\\\\log h)$ inside $o(n+h\\\\log^{3/2} h)$ time considering the source point $s$, such that given any query point $t$, the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path should be determined inside $o(\\\\log n)$ time. considering a two-point queries, with $o(n+h^2\\\\log^2 h)$ time and space preprocessing, the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path should be determined inside $o(\\\\log n+\\\\log^2 h)$ time considering any two query points $s$ and $t$; alternatively, with $o(n+h^2\\\\cdot \\\\log^{2} h \\\\cdot 4^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log h}})$ time and $o(n+h^2\\\\cdot \\\\log h \\\\cdot 4^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log h}})$ space preprocessing, we should answer each two-point query inside $o(\\\\log n)$ time.',\n",

       "       'a existence of closed loops of degeneracies inside crystals has been intimately connected to associated crystal symmetries, raising a question: what was a minimum symmetry required considering topological character, and should one find an example? triclinic caas$_3$, inside space group $p{\\\\bar 1}$ with only the center of inversion, has been found to display, without need considering tuning, the nodal loop of accidental degeneracies with topological character, centered on one face of a brillouin zone that was otherwise fully gapped. a small loop was very flat inside energy, yet was cut four times by a fermi energy, the condition that results inside an intricate repeated touching of inversion related pairs of fermi surfaces at weyl points. spin-orbit coupling lifts a fourfold degeneracy along a loop, leaving trivial kramers pairs. with its single nodal loop that emerges without protection from any point group symmetry, caas$_3$ represents a primal \"hydrogen atom\" of nodal loop systems.',\n",
       "       'robust pca, a problem of pca inside a presence of outliers has been extensively investigated inside a last few years. here we focus on robust pca inside a outlier model where each column of a data matrix was either an inlier or an outlier. most of a existing methods considering this model assumes either a knowledge of a dimension of a lower dimensional subspace or a fraction of outliers inside a system. however inside many applications knowledge of these parameters was not available. motivated by this we propose the parameter free outlier identification method considering robust pca which a) does not require a knowledge of outlier fraction, b) does not require a knowledge of a dimension of a underlying subspace, c) was computationally simple and fast d) should handle structured and unstructured outliers. further, analytical guarantees are derived considering outlier identification and a performance of a algorithm was compared with a existing state of a art methods inside both real and synthetic data considering various outlier structures.',\n",
