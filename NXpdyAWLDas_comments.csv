Honestly my biggest fear is all the boomers who are going to believe any video they see on Facebook and use it to shape opinions...
"Could photographers and film makers ask money when AI used their footage / photos to learn?
Like what libraries now are doing with text AI that uses all the books online to learn without paying a part of the costs made by putting all that information out on the internet?"
"All, please, notice the subtle inconsistencies in the hand movement of Marques. Dude, you have been generated! But seriously, in my opinion, the question of accessibility and price will be a huge bottleneck for the technology. My guess of future application is, as Marques mentioned, the stock footage industry, but in a limited way. In the end, the AI custom footage may become as expensive as actually paying a freelancer. But one thing is for shure, we will see more of spaghetti smith on youtube. Brace yourself."
"As concerning as it may be, AI like this is likely the only way we'll ever get to the Holodeck. Tell the computer what you want to see, let it generate the scene, and step into it (using VR or something). That's the next step after video generation, and environment/game designers will freak out over it."
"If anyone is wondering what sora means, it means sky in Japanese, and should be pronounced like ""so-la"""
Are you AI?
"You're welcome bro, thanks for the information - it was thorough as fuck. My mind is ü§Ø you're always enjoyable to go to for Information after I stumbled upon your videos because of ai lmao. Or algorithms."
Plot twist this whole YouTube video is also AI generated.
Right at 2:24 her legs switch positions XD and at 2:33 she skips
Can you talk about ai characters in game. I mean something  like Unreal engine 5 may be
"OMG... use the link given above, watch the woman walking on the rain-soaked street, and look at her legs at the 0:15 mark!! her legs get ""confused""... it's like an Escher drawing!!!"
This is just whats released to the public...imagine the army had this tech 60 years before we ever got it. So picture what they kept for themselves.
Jesus is coming soon and he loves you.John 3:16 says ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that He have His Only Begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but Have eternal life‚Äù come to God He loves you dearly.
"would be amazing getting SORA to ""read a book"" and generate a movie based on it"
How long before AI becomes smarter than humanity‚Äôs most intelligent geniuses?
is this video old? I remember you posting this about  year ago
Its funny how AI struggle with drawing hands just like humans do
"I feel like that a law should be in place that all AI video must have some kind of irremovable marker on them, whether visible on the picture itself, or in the file data."
I cant wait for this to eventually be applied as a lay over to old video games to upscale them live while playing.....
I'm waiting for someone to intergrate this software with Unreal Engine 5üòÆüòÆ
"What ai will do in 10 years.

Weird how it‚Äôs just gone to photo realism. Might be good for stock videos and images. But I don‚Äôt see it being useful outside of that. The general consensus seems people don‚Äôt like ai generated content.
"Even AI has difficulty drawing hands, that makes it more human, scary af"
2:40 THE FEET SHUFFLING!?
Just wait until you write a prompt to create a video game.
"Just scratching the surface of storytelling and creative expression, VideoGPT quietly steps in, enriching my videos with a touch of finesse and professionalism."

"I mean guys lets be for real, I'm fucking scared"
"My entire channel is based on making music with my own lyrics, using AI. Ai sing, plays guitar, drums, AND most importantly brings it all together without me needing to do anything other than write the lyrics. You don't even need to write your own lyrics. You can ask the AI to write you a song in any genre about any subject that you want... It wont be as good as it is with some personality but its still kinda fuggin freaky ngl...  Absolutely blows my mind, almost makes me feel dirty so I try to be honest about my AI endeavors. You can already make entire YouTube videos with AI... AND I'm late to the party."
"So with all the discussions on how disruptive and destructive AI is to the entire creative industry, the big question is what or who is driving this forward? Some one is getting rich off of all this, someone sees a need for this - At what point do we say this technology is good enough, it employees the maximum amount of people and drives a competitive and lucrative business model for as many people who desire to pursue a career in this industry?"
This is so damn sketchy‚Ä¶
Not even video proof is believable anymore‚Ä¶
"Jokes aside, we all know AI will only get exponentially better, meaning that the possibilities of it's misuse are literally infinite. We need to get serious and figure out the best way to prevent malicious use while not infringing on anyone's freedoms, and also NOT just hand it all over to any government whatsoever because we obviously know what kind of creatively repulsive ways they'd try to use it to their own advantage, and everyone's else's expense. Hard problem to solve, and they're most likely going to politicize it, so be ready for the storm üòÇ"
"If anyone sees this comment in like 3 years when nobody can tell what's real and what's fake, just remember where everything started, with will smith eating pasta."
The world is coming to an end
"the japanese girl walking has the leggs bugged, stll work to do"
You can make your own movies or video games one day. Or hell make your own books...and upload other peoples movies/games/books. The future is bright but it's also dark because people are always going to show their evil side.If you make your own games you can make an MMO with just you as a human and everyone else is AI generated including people joining your party and fighting bosses together. Or make your own Call of Duty type game fighting AI that's better then fighting humans and you can have different servers filled with AI bots acting as people making your games extremly populated.
"I feel like people should start using Will Smith AI eating spaghetti as a meme, if it hasn't been done so already"
"Is it possible with Sora to generate a second video preseving the situation and persons from the first one?
So e.g. first video prompt ""Jack is a middle aged smart guy, who picks up his fair hair girl-friend Linda at home.""
Second video prompt: ""Jack and Linda are arriving at the italian restaurant 'Roma'.""
Then will it be the same car and same two persons in the second video?"
Reminds me of ‚ÄúA Scanner Darkly‚Äù can you imagine them just using AI to make that movie?
"Hello, I have a story and I need AI to animate it . Who can help me with thi? I wanted to do it with AI videogen AI but i have no sufficient funds to subscribe to It.
If I could get help, I would be glad to share it."

Welcome to the matrix!
"I was just chatting to a colleague and telling him how at the start of VFX it was very much a programmer oriented field. Then it changed and shifted towards artists, the 90s were the golden era. And then shifted back towards development. We‚Äôre now back to square one. 

Who knows, maybe it‚Äôs a cyclic thing. Fingers crossed ü§û"
WE went to our ChatGPT account and into Sora and we were unable to create anything. It kept giving us storyboards
"7:17 If you look close enough at the reflections, you can see the AI holding the camera."
If i may ask do these generated images and videos existed before or its Ai imagenation?
If i may ask do these generated images and videos existed before or its Ai imagenation?
vivimos en una simulacion la ai sora lo a demostrado teniamos la razon que queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"I've been a VFX professional for 30 years and hobbyist for 42 years. Started as a kid on my vic20 in 1982. I now know I need to branch out. I do not trust the advertising and film industries to protect artists and creators in any way, it's the end of an era. I would never have thought when I started this profession, which was completely novel at the time, it would last less than a generation. It's mad. But it's happening.

Artists will go first. As a supervisor, I would see my job go from supervising teams of humans to supervising AI tools. A bleak and lonely prospect..

As Marques says, AI imagery will not come up with anything new creatively speaking. We will fall into what I call ""cultural regurgitation"". Films and videos will bland out and worsen global ""idiocracy"". It's immensely sad but I know greed in the industry will be stronger than will to fight for creativity. It will take several generations before things, maybe, turn around.

Btw I'm not saying AI is evil, I'm not a luddite either, I have an next gen personal AI on my phone (better than chatGpt) and am amazed at how it can enhance my hobbies and research. But work wise... it's a cataclysm that has already started occurring."

"at one point her leg buckles they look funny like they crossed over, like mannequins legs. odd"
Another video creator with facial hair?
"Nice, now we know for sure we can't trust anything anymore that we see on the internet. And it's another perfect A.I for a lot of people to lose their jobs. 

Good job A.I People! Another step into the direction of ''no 'humans requiered' And to pump up competition that is already absurd even more."
We will adjust to living with this. Birth rate is going downhill and replacing workers with AI doing regular and repetitive jobs will be a good thing going forward.
"Everything, commercial, PR, even vloggers just talking, artisists, even musicians, be ready your life's will get a hell of lot tougher in about 1-5 years! ALOT! Get a education working with people face to face, you be safe the next 50 so years, only."
"Who else wants to see so remake the will smith spaghetti to see the v2?!? Oh just me then, will have to get sora I guess"
How expensive was making these videos ? How long is the prompt to generate these  AI  clips ?
"the thing is that they won't generate the content this if you don't give the AI enough examples, if we get to the point where AI copies AI then it'll get weird again"
You are a cool dude
Weird feet swap at 2:27.
AI can't create a puzzle solving a human being. It won't do it.
I gave this video a dislike simply because the thumbnail was misleading. So sick of this clickbait garbage.
"if you are interested in some valuable content completely made by AI tools, well... here I am {lol}"
"I want to use this to make videos for my music. Could they make it so you can upload images of yourself and then AI can use your image, so instead of random people you could have a virtual you doing crazy things."

"These tools taking away our jobs as stock photo and stock video people, youtubers, artists etc. should just lead to people having more freetime for the same pay"
i mean... jobs evolve. before drones videographers used to have to do all sorts to get those shots. then we got drones. like i hate all this ai don't get me wrong but so many jobs have been nixed due to evolving tech and it's not ever gonna stop
At 2:24 the girl switches right and left leg

Hey mark! S23 FE or Pixel 7?

3:06 i thought this was beamng drive.. This AI thing is scaring me in psychological levels I cant explain
Could AI be used to create popular YouTubers for every imaginable niche? MB probably fine with 18.6 million subscribers..
"Ai should be used for saving lives and doing repetitive jobs no one wants to do, not creative jobs.. I am so scared about all the possible videos we can create with it and how it could generate innapropriate or harmful videos of real persons, there surely will be people able to bypass the filter even if they do add one if they know how to code.. We won't be able to trust anything on the internet.. 
It also hurts to know that so many people never cared about the process of how products are made, and that artists be it in music, drawing, modelling have had their value reduced, even though art is everywhere in media and real life. I believe technology has its uses, but we should also conserve the human and natural parts of life. Technology needs to help humans, make products more environmentally friendly, build houses so the cost of having a home is reduced and less people are homeless, so as humans, we can finally allow ourselves to learn creative tasks. Learning is what makes life fun. Sharing knowledge and your imagination is so important."

"When it comes to making ai art, people, videos, voices, etc‚Ä¶ ai needs to be destroyed"
All these Mega Medias like YouTube Google FB X etc should create a feature to capture all the AI generated contents and let viewers know through some watermark or something stating the content has AI generated videos or writings . This will keep the viewer aware that the content is not real but AI included. Another day to save the real world from fake world.
Ai generated things like images and vids should be made illegal since it uses other peoples videos and images to create these as well as just how many shady things you could do with it I mean there comes a limit to how much AI should be upgraded
Explain to me how we are supposed to use this now that dall e 3 stopped making realistic or real life depiction of images?

"How i predict YouTube, all videos ai generated, all ai official YouTube videos will be set to be at the top of all search results, big subscribers will exist and be featured, small, tiny, micro channels, will have to pay for advertising to get more views"
"Wow. Gotta say I‚Äôve known hundreds of people in dozens of jobs are were replaced by automation from toll booth staff to operating room personnel to cashiers so it‚Äôs not surprising. The problem is that people in the industry itself often contribute to its demise. ‚ÄúWho would pay for stock footage when they could generate it for free?‚Äù. The answer should be those consumers who buy the service most and those most worried they‚Äôll be made obsolete yet they‚Äôre the very people who will use it. It still amazes me that people who work retail will happily direct you to use self checkout or order online if they don‚Äôt have what you want. 

As far as will it be able to be as creative as humans I don‚Äôt see why not. Humans are also trained on everything that came before them and then to varying degrees and aptitude apply what they‚Äôve seen and learned in order to create new things. The difference here is the sheer volume of information it can pull from and the lack of constraints it has. AI can produce things independent of natural and societal limitations that humans have. One AI program can create stories from limitless perspectives whereas humans are often limited by themselves and society to not engage in things like cultural appropriation. Ai has no one to answer to in that regard."
"It's unlikely that it will get much better than this. I would even dare say that it might decrease in quality over time. Reason being is that as more AI content floods the web and begins to overtake organic content, eventually more AI content  complete with all those tiny imperfections will be used as references in AI tools and thus essentially cause AI to eat itself."
"So, I see this quickly making the Internet less interesting, as it is now, to a large portion of the population. It'll be like wrestling, and all that aesthetic attracts. You'll have to ask people to go a long with it, to accept what is fake. That's distasteful, boring. Not to mention, everything will be questionable. So, why share? Why waste time on social media?"
"this is just the beginning, were going to start seeing actors be able to license out their entire likeness, actors wont have to act anymore they will be able to license out their ""AI package"" to studios and they can use them for the movie at a lower price, instead of will smith having to actually act for 6-12 weeks for 20 million he can just license his AI package out with his voice and likeness for 5 million and never have to do any work. All the stars of today will be ageless and we can still get movies from actors after they pass or from when they were younger, maybe like a young Eddie murphy in a new comedy movie. its limitless im sure there are many more ideas people could think of"

Thank you for sharing this! These things seem to be moving very quickly. I just discovered Fireframe which creates music videos out of your music and Cyberlink just released an AI Anime video generator.
"The ""drone"" shot @7:00 has creepy implications when it comes to dystopian futures. Most people don't travel, so millions could live their entire lives thinking the outside world is a pristine gem, when in reality the media has all been using AI generated videos to hide the fact that it is a polluted wasteland."
What is even crazier is that AI learning curve is exponential. Meaning that in less than 6 months we are looking at an improvement as big or even bigger thana Will Smith eating Spaghetti to now.
I¬¥ve watched these videos and I can just say it¬¥s mindblowing right now how much this will progress. Basically you will just put a movie script in this and BAM you have a new movie made. And you don't even have to write the script by yourself...

Europe knows what art and creativity are, so they are trying to limit AI right now.

"I can literally see and feel no life in them, but AI is making strides."
Ying Yang ...Cool but dangerous. We defnitly need a law that AI videos need a visible logo on the corner when you post it somewhere to show that it is AI generated. If not we get a serious problem if someone is messing around with it and nobody can stop him by law.
Such a high level of systemic deception isn't sustainable. Global authority will ensue to mitigate the sociopolitical chaos.
Rip animators
Independent films would love this!
Humans are obsolete.
"ur overreacting, this will be used for good political movements."
Does this mean that book writers will be able to personally produce movies based on their books? It will be impressive!
"In the future, the film industry is likely to shift its focus.
Rather than producing movies aimed at a broad audience, professionals may begin creating smaller components designed to be utilized by artificial intelligence (AI). Numerous small companies or individuals will invest in this market to supply movie components or assets to feed the AI.
Individuals would then use the AI to generate personalized movies tailored to their preferences.
It is the same phenomenon observed with computer art assets (like textures, sounds, music, and video game maps) where one individual creates an asset for others to consume in their own creations.
Major studio-produced movies may continue to uphold high standards of quality and retain elements of originality, a principle that extends to existing franchises or copyrighted material. However, their prevalence might diminish owing to a surge in demand for personalized AI-generated content. Major streaming platforms could potentially offer tools for users to create these personalized movies alongside, or even beyond, streaming mainstream films.
Everyone will be able to enjoy the ideal movie, generated rather than selected, according to their current mood. Maybe the main plot could be changed instantly, enabling the choice of alternative endings or adjustments to various scenes. These modifications might extend to elements such as setting, and fundamental traits of characters, as well as the recreation of variations of already-known stories.
You'll no longer debate about a movie you and your friend have watched (or wish to watch), but instead about a movie you've personally designed. Furthermore, you might even compare the two versions of the same plot generated by the AI for you and your friend.

Imagine you've just watched Titanic and ask the AI: 'how would the story have ended if the piece of driftwood that Rose and Jack were floating on had been larger?"
Damn...... this is terrifying for fact check............. but also really good for creativity. I'm torn.
"Whoa, just think about the gaming industry. Live AI generated vr game, just pop the headset on and boom, you are wherever you want"

Hi Nick Kurr
"statistical generative models (which is what we're calling AI here because it surprises people with tackling seemingly too complex problems) doesn't eliminate the decision making process that HAS to happen for any non-trivial task people care about. at best it acts as an auto-complete and advanced search within a design space, and even at that, it is miles and miles away from what we need for a true design assistant. NONE of these generative models explain anything about the underlying principles for designs, nor the constraints. i.e. we learn almost nothing, gain no new insights. the biggest winners are big companies that can cash in on the short term with black box predictors and generators to satisfy a market long enough to make a quick buck before the market notices the smarts aren't all that smart, but rather generic, after the initial surprises."

"It‚Äôs crazy how many YouTubers are pushing the technology that will ultimately be their fall. In 10 years, you‚Äôll be able to type into an AI search engine ‚ÄúMarvel DC crossover superhero movie directed like Quentin Tarantino with Hans Zimmer score. 2 hours long shot by Roger Deakins‚Äù
And it will be able to auto generate movies. That‚Äôs not even that far fetched. There‚Äôs already AI music, AI video, life-like AI video. 
Am I the only one that hopes this type of generative AI becomes banned? I don‚Äôt see how this will improve our world for the better"
"Guys I‚Äôm a freshman studying graphic design, should I switch majors‚Ä¶."
"I think Sora (at the very least) will be an excellent tool for exploring video ideas to see how they work before shooting it properly. Kind of like using Midjourney or Dall-E as an instant sketchbook which can be used as a reference. I also think it will be excellent for making artificial scenery, background videos, etc., aswell as a low budget option for stock footage, animations etc. And in the future I imagine it (or some other AI-program) will be capable of making feature length films and all kinds of new video-based entertainment."
üòÆ
Framerate in reflections being lower is super realistic. I assume training for reflections was done separately with CGI: same clips without and with ray traced reflections so it learns what a reflection is without distractions.
think about this- this tech has been around for at least 30 years. Imagine that for a second
"At this rate next year, AI will read our minds and tell us what to do or  is that already happening ? üò≥"
ENDLESS
It can 100% be creative in ways humans have never been.
The human generated creative process has just died.
"I think what unnerving so many of us about recent advances in AI and robotics:   We were good with the idea of AI and robots replacing the jobs people don't want to do, but NOT with replacing the jobs people DO want to do.   And AI art, film making, music and so many other things intrude in to replacing the jobs that people really value and help give their life more meaning. It's like, what will be left for us to do, just hit the buffet?"
"A lot of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù companies are scamming saying it‚Äôs all AI generated when in reality they have a team of animators, graphic, videographers, and special effect artists that create these videos then just say it‚Äôs AI. The videos requested from caption are never generated right away like a computer would do it‚Äôs always a couple days or so from what I‚Äôve noticed. I haven‚Äôt really tapped into AI at all to say this is a fact but I have heard about companies scamming this way and I don‚Äôt believe a lot of nonsense online so people are afraid they don‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs real but. You shouldn‚Äôt believe AI is 100% real either. But what do I know I never went to college"
Can you imagine when you tell it to make a movie based on whatever you want and it does and it's good.
Detroit: Become Human is actually happening
Where can AI video be generated. I need to use this

"Well Well, maybe we are entering in an age where the digitalisation is getting kind of obsolete ? Where Film cameras or physical objects are maybe the only things trustable again ?

"I wish there's a job for just taking pictures, and build a collection of it for the AI to traine with it, instead of taking other people's work to traine the ai"
"I've already noticed them out. If you look at some of the commercials here, like there's one with Dwayne Johnson and Oprah Winfrey. They may have pose for the picture together but somebody edited it very heavily to the point that you won't see them talking on camera cuz you'll know that they're not saying what the commercial is saying but it sounds just like them"
TBH you look AI generated
"a lot of people commenting like they worried about the future with this, honestly i think this can only keep improving thats why its ai, it learns and improves, im so excited to use this in the future so i dont have to spend hours or days creating a single animation scene"
"I am from the future. Everything is going to be automated and no jobs will be left for us common folks. We all gonna have no jobs and either fight the Ai robots or each other while the rich and powerful watch from afar, drinking GPT sparkling water. In the matter of 6 months from the start of the ai dynasty, 80% of humanity will be obliterated.

I hope if you‚Äôre reading you become successful
It can‚Äôt get more creative as the history of creation so far‚Ä¶ even if this is true a regular person gets not even 1% of the history of creation so far BUT every regular person can give these generated videos meaning and purpose

Can I generate my own personal video through SORA to be animated
Thumbnail looks like FORTNITE
i'm sorry but that will smith eating spaghetti clip is the funniest thing i've seen all week
"If I upload a AI generated thing, as a content creator, I feel disgusted. Ofcourse it could have some things, improved, with AI, but nah, I would like to feel proud that I made something myself. I guess some have this feeling too. (on the other side, it looks pretty good and yeah, why not generating video's that are nothing personal for free in moments you could just sit and wait) love-hate relation, lol"
i swear we gonna start be convicted because of AI vids..
I can't wait for more A.I. generated fake news on tv.
"im pretty sure if we give all this AI stuff a good 50 years to consolidate every AI for creating text prompts and videos and such we could potentially just give a prompt on what we want to watch as a series and the AI will generate us that.... like yeah ""i liked this movie called Eragon so can you make me a sequel to it based on the book series."" and the AI just makes us that... 
tbh something like the manga stories where there is a super AI running a VR game where the game just makes every NPC feel like they are a real person and you can just earn skills by doing stuff and all the quest lines are AI generated based on how you completed the previous step would be insane thing to see and based on how good these videos were i would imagine we could get really close to that with just having a AI make a entire game or movie or whatever and then its just curated by a small group of people who will make sure everything is good enough to sell and not have inconsistencies and out of place stuff and so on..."
SORA will PUMP
"That Will Smith video is terrifying üòÇ AI can be a great tool, but we need to be careful going forward."
Mark my prediction. 2025 will be the actual beginning of the AI era better than the basic we have seen we saw the first telephone and it was amazing until they released the iPhone what we have is telephone. And it won't be until 8-10 years till the AI starts affecting job on a scale the people are claiming. 2025 will be the beginning of the multimodal AI(decent modal not the crap we have now). If course in 5-7 years there will be protests and slowing down of development and lots of ethical questions and fair use and stuff and court hearing and meeting like they do with social media platforms now. So I'd say most jobs should be safe for atleast next 10 years. 2035 the shxt hits the fan. The year we would see major upgrade in the robotic industry and the evolution of AI into something much great. 2026 a pretty dependable video generation modal by 2028 lots of industries will begin to implement and integrate AI on large scale 2030 AI goes everywhere on all devices even specialized home ai and if course we would have way better AI contect prediction tools and tons of rules on AI content which would all fade start fading away around 2050- the guy from 2051

"your video is Copied by German Youtuber Dhruv Rathee

This is kinda crazy
I still think Will Smith eating Spaghetti is the style of Ai art that we should keep for at least the next 10 years. Just for style reasons.
The weird hand movements are very unnatural and disturbing to me.
"And I just started to get my No Ai Art out there üíî...


I will not give up and Neither should you ü´µ‚ú® 



By the way I love your videos you Are brilliant I will not chance you for an Ai No matter What !"
Wait until A.I can actually manipulate physical matter and create real physical reality's.
AI is threatening. Engineers always create something that takes away other people's jobs. Stop. We already have the technology needed to survive as a human on this planet.
"Fun fact, Sora mean picture in Arabic."
"My grandma grew up, taking a candle into the cow stable... no swiping images of loved ones around the world on a tablet.... 
Yes, technology can be disruptive. Let's make good stuff with it."
Absolutely terrifying üòû I honestly hate the direction this technology is going. I really was hoping it wasn't going to come to be THIS good but here we are...
I have a question on a different topic. What camera do you use to shoot this type of video of yours?
"I hate seeing all the technology and money that can help billions of people... just went right into the field that requires no help like this! What could happened if people who are capable try making robots or program that could help people with disability or elderly. Or imagine this much effort went into creating something that can help clean the street, perform first-aid, respond emergency call, be a helpers of health-care field, patrol the street etc... anything will help! But replace digital creativity like this barely help anyone! Instead of honing one skill and mind through craftmanship/arts human are forced to do leftovers works that is physically and mentally exhausting. Let ai do all the creativity and we human do the boring and tiring works? Why? Shouldn't we left one of the few field that can make hobby into jobs alone? Is being born into human not depressing enough. We wouldn't do this to other animals that we love so why... This is the very same feeling I had when I watched very rich people use the money 99% of the population could never have to destroy the world we all live in. It's your money but we all live in this world together... Go built your own world! I don't want to suffer the consequences of someone stupidity and ignorance!"
ai is crazy
So it begins
"Unfortunately, we'll have to live with the potential opportunities and risks - and both are unlimited. Welcome to the new normal."
We're screwed.
How come I can only get 5 second looping videos?  Nothing that long.
few more years and everyone gonna create their own movies and series.  No  more Hardcore VFX editing. No more actors. everything will be AI generated human
"AI is not great, the great is who made AI."
Why are most of the AI generated videos in slow mo?
"I'm gonna be honest with yall, ai will never be able to replace humans. No matter how advanced it gets, you'll always be able to tell the difference between human and AI work. AI has a specific unrealistic style in all its videos and pictures. Look for outlines in videos, AI can't replicate human styles and animation the way it perceives stereotypical digital artwork and videos. Even with writing, AI can't add soul to stories or documents like humans can. In every AI text, picture, and video, there will always be an unrealistic and disturbing mistake or something that doesn't make sense. But if I'm being honest, occupations that require creativity will be very hard to get considering the direction the world is headed.  Drawing, writing, filming, etc are amazing hobbies. But realistically, in order to strive in the future, a job linked with technology will have to do. Maybe something that AI cant replicate at all like engineering, medical, or psychology might work. Technology can and will be the future, it's not going to be impossible to become an artist, writer, animator, or photographer in 10-15 years. But it'll be very very hard. Start learning about investing and technology and keep those things as hobbies. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is the direction the world is going. Love you guys and stay safe ‚ù§ [copy pasting this on every AI video I see]"
"7:43 That horse vanishing is indeed a giveaway, but what about the horse (cow?) directly behind it that is ONLY HALF A HORSE WITH TWO LEGS??? xD"
eventually this is going to be used to create video of somebody doing something illegal and it's going to get used against them. They need to keep this closed
People will be able to generate fake footage of people committing crimes. We will be able to frame people. Hacking will be next level once AI can start creating its own code from scratch. It‚Äôs gonna get weird.
"Wow, this is seriously mind-blowing. But think about it, getting framed for something you didn't do because of AI-generated evidence? That's just downright creepy, isn't it?"
"So considering very soon, nothing online can be trusted anymore as a source of information or truth. Maybe it's time for the general public to yeet their electronics out of the window, and start interacting face to face again."
"I think within 15 years there will be fully created full 2 hrs movies designed by human, created by AI. There will be so much content and great movies to watch that Hollywood will collapse."

Color TV to 100% market share? 30 years? iPhone? 7 years. Pokemon Go? 14 days. AI? I have no clue, but for sure not 30 years again. When did you bought your first smartphone? Does anyone still use the Nokia brick? ""because its so good"" ...."

"Sound and audio generation still has a ways to go though... Your job is safe, for now."
"This is the most disturbing thing since Enlightenment started. The programmers don't even understand how it works, so you can't say that this is not magic. I now know how non-Westerners felt when they said that cameras capture your soul in a picture. We are slipping back into a Dark Age, where information is not discarded but meaningless."
This is nuts.
"Next step: you tell your TV what kind of movie you'd like to watch, and it is generated on the fly.
Final step: you don't need to tell anything, Netflix will just show you hundreds of AI-generated movies and TV shows based on your taste.
The downside is that all these movies and TV shows will be empty, lacking the human touch."
Imagine movie producers and Hollywood have been using this feature for years and we just now finding abt it

"Once humans make themselves obsolete, those in power won't need them anymore. A government that neither cares about or needs it's people is a dictatorship.

7:30 the horse just went for a visit to the backrooms lol
The stock image/video/music/writing industries are at the biggest risk from AI in my opinion. They can just crank out things that used to take a decent amount of effort in mere minutes. Maybe it will shrink and just become polishing up AI generated anything into a convincing product.

"I really had to take a deep breath. I am not sure what I think about this. It is amazing from a technological point of view. But It is also an incredible powerful tool. And, well, people and powerful tools are a combination that did not work quite well in the past. Further, this is only what we can see. This is what is published. There is a lot more in the developer studios that is way more advanced and we can not see."

"We are not the demographic for this, our kids kids are. They will erase and rewrite history and use fake video's and pictures to make theme believe its true"
That video of the women walking had weird things happening with her legs still
"Do you really know, what's this emphasizing ?"
I‚Äôm squinting my eyes wondering if this entire vid isn‚Äôt AI generated. Yes. I have trust issues now.
AI seems to have a problem with the movement of legs. They usually morph into each other. Look at her legs to know what I mean. It's hard to miss.
"Some day in the future, maybe 20 years, it will be realistic
One week later...
NOT THAT FAST!!!!!üò±üò±üò±"
Imagine watching an entire movie that was just created through someone giving details of what they want. No skill put into it
Extremely sad...
Its literally content theft using all the past data from people who surely dont agree to share it.
"I really do think that AI should not be advanced, especially in the content creation field. It takes away everything that is fun just for the greed..."
"keep in mind actress Gal Godot sued those who DeepFaked a face swap in a porn that she didn't give permission to those who did it. she won & legal precidence has been set. ''Relax, Don't Do It'' says Frankie Goes To Hollywood.üé∂‚òÆÔ∏è‚ú®

"There will always be groundbreaking technologies that eliminate whole swaths of jobs and industries. Typewriters eliminated pro copywriters, computers eliminated Typists and much more, cars freed horses, etc. this is the next great wave of change. Adapt or die."
This is why Tyler Perry just paused on a huge project worth like 800 million i think because he heard of this tech
AI Adult content about to go crazy....
I kept looking at your hand at the end of the clip just to see if the whole thing is AI generated...
Open AI is alien technology. In 2 years it has changed the world.
"The sheer fact that optical illusions exist means that one‚Äôs vision cannot be trusted to reflect reality. This has been debated for centuries. 
The difficulty lies in relaying this fact to society writ large. 
The truly exciting and logical next step is 3d virtual generation. With the release of platforms such as Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro, this will be a reality sooner than we may think.
Exciting, yes. Terrifying, absolutely."
Woah this ai stuff is impressive. It kinda looks like CGI
Was this person ai2? Like I feel like I need to ask this all the time nowüòê. Great video by the way!
Absolutely super scary! You can't even believe video You See online anymore. I'm just thinking about the implications of the genocide that's happening in the gaza. Can you imagine that Israel AI generated a bunch of video to show that the people of Gaza were happy after Israel invaded and destroyed their homes and that they rebuilt Gaza for them but really there's nothing there. This is super scary as!
"So, where is the new video abouth Smith and spaghetti?"
Is it free ?
This is not a good thing.
Character assassination of political leaders allows AI to shift voter‚Äôs opinion days before an election when there is no time for defense or exposing it.
"Damn why everyone saying ""AI is gonna destroy Internet"" like it's finna take over the world soon so yes, Internet is f-first. Take Over internet first. ü§£ü§£


We are coming are COMING üíÄü§£ü§£ü§°"
I wonder if the audio is also generated in timing with the video?
Can't wait to see what people come up with
Imagine AI generated actors for movies
What if this whole video is generated by AIü§î
The good thing is that you can still tell that it‚Äôs ai generated by small details like when the woman was walking her leg was twisting around and the fingers were really long in each video
"One year from now..

""Make me a new Quentin Tarantino style movie.""

You watch it and change the things out that you don't like. Run with the great ideas. A few paragraphs later, you have a whole ass movie."

"Asbestos was legal until it wasn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt worry, we will learn once the damage is done."
"awesome ! good vibes sharing in your descriptions! love your sens of humor ! totally agree as a vfx artist about the implications, and in the same time mind blown about the possibilities !"
"forgive me for even thinking about this but just all the ethical and even legal grey areas that could arise from this technology, like would pc backwards generated by this be illegal or even just corn in general with celebrities. I feel like an unrestricted/jailbroken version of this could cause a lot of damage."
wait ... Mamques are you real?
The 19th century workers who rebelled against machines replacing human labour would approve of this comment section üëèüëè
5:25 the reason why his faces looks real is because PHOTO AI looks real.... these shots have almost zero subject movement and just camera movements and gimmicks to trick the viewer that this is something groundbreaking. The merit here is on the PHOTO AI achievements
What people don't understand is that MAJORITY OF THESE OUTPUTS are either 1) PHOTO AI outputs with camera gimmick movements or 2) VIDEOGAME like stuff
People being impressed by videogame like footage LOL
Soon we will be able to put our thoughts into videos
"0:33 Watch her feet. At one point, her walk is all wonky, and she looks like she's trotting or skipping."
"These deepfakes are unreal, I had to rewatch to believe it was fake"
I also tried Mistral on enterprise-ai and it was legit
Curious what you thought
So fake it freaks me out!
If AI makes deepfakes this good I'm staying off social media.
"I don't trust deepfakes, feel like I'm living in a sci-fi movie now."
Deepfakes are crazy but also make me kinda sad in a way.
While everyone is scared and complaining about A.I advancements. I‚Äôm excited! üòÑ
Creative industries are going to take major hit because of this Gen AI frenzy
How can  I know this video is not generated by AI?
"yeah, there's sound now for all of these videos. Took two weeks it looks like lol"

Who cares about how real this looks they are cutting out more jobs for people that went to school to learn how to do what they do.
"We are not more than 20 years away from legitimate matrix within the matrix. All this computer driven world creation that reacts real time to our own inputs, connected to every nerve in our body through nuralink.. topped with advancements in artificial nutrient delivery systems, we will have the option (or be forced into) a world like that of Veelox, the world where all inhabitants live in VR reality, hooked up to computers, of their own free will, in the Pendragon series book The Reality Bug."
"Wow. These are all really scary....... until you stop and realize they're all less than 30 seconds long and anything longer than, say, 10 or so seconds, tends to exhibit the same issues the Will Smith Spaghetti video does."
Encourage ai generated detector
"Until now, HUMANS have written the algorithms that have created AI. Just wait till we teach AI to improve on itself."
"Women, children, and marginalized people are gonna be harmed so much more with this by creating graphic images and videos of these people. Imagine all the deepfakes if your friends, your kids, showinf them in provocative situations, and imagine all of the terrible brutal videos of simulated violence and death towards them as well. Not to mention, as a graphic art major in college rn Im so afraid of if i'll have a job by the time I graduate. Fuck me man, I hate this. not to be a doomer or anhthing but I dont think ANYONE wants this"

Eating spaghetti should be standard test for AI generated videos
Hollywood is overrated anyways. It should get replaced by AI
I will be unemployed in about one year. Any ideas for ai-proof professions for an ex motion designer?
"this is insane. we are a few steps away from ""hey computer, analyze all the books I have ever read and and all the movies I have ever watched and generate me one for tonight that I will like, French New-wave style, black and white, grainy 16mm enlarged to 35mm look drama set in the 1960s, make it 1h20 min."" - goodbye filmmakers."
"This will be a great disruption in the HollyWood movie industry. My goodness, the possibilities are exciting and frightening, more on the frightening side."
"If you saw the training footage, you'd understand why these are so good. These people are feeding them stuff and then asking the system for exactly what they put in. They're a pack of scam artists. This stuff does NOT work, and they're going to be sued into nonexistence."
"I think that the best use for AI generated videos would be for some very specific stock footage. But in example, I don't think it would be very useful for making a full movie. In example, you could not isolate one single character or actor on the movie and edit its movement, change a bit the position, or the camera angle. It is very different from a video composition in After Effects, when you have control over the inidvidual assets you have in the scene."
Sora AI
2:18 just look at her legs
"Well, well, what will it be in the end? Skynet or Utopia?"
AI is the greatest technology of humanity.
90% ai videos feel like a nightmare
Damn what camera and and lens are you using?
cool
This is exponential growth (singularity) for you in real life. Paradigm shift every six months. Trying to adjust to that speed is so obviously impossible it's beyond nightmarish.
But we do agree that the AI learning machine receives input from the internet database right?
This is giving criminals a chance to easily frame others
Do you think they‚Äôll release a Chat GPT 4.5 before an actual 5.0 module?
"I clicked your link to Sora and got completely lost... I see some API documentation, is it for programmers only? Can a regular user try it somehow? Thanks."
"this AI image generation has improved greatly in such a short time and surely it'll improve so much as to be no longer distinguishable from real videography! but as said in this good video as well as elsewhere, the issues of image copyrights will be a real problem anyways ..."
"mind blown, thanks marques"
Your new favorite steamer is probably already an AI.
What if we're all just text based creatures in a sand box?
"Video is just information. We have already solved this problem. Information can be displayed in all sorts of ways. The challenge lies in verifying the source. For this, you can use a network of trust. Nobody wants to tarnish their name. So, you sign the video with a source that has built up a reputation."
"It's also no coincidence that media companies and newspapers are getting rid of staff. If they can create an Ai newscaster/presenter to deliver the EXACT message they wish to impart, then why have 'real' humans employed?! ... The same with newspapers! Why bother having journalists if Ai can create content!?!"
"Another thing to keep in mind ... By the time Ai software arrives at consumer level, one can bet their bottom dollar that govt's intelligence agencies are already using next level Ai to create whatever agenda/Psy-Op they wish"

The scare is now different but there still."
every AI generated source of media needs a watermark that should be visible enforced by law or we end up in a dystopia.
"AI steals (learns) from our online pictures and videos.  AI can't make an arm without using a picture of an arm.  Where does AI grab these?  From our online pictures and videos.  AI takes a cheek from me, a cheek from your picture, an arm from someone else's picture to create a ""new"" video/picture.  Meaning, AI porn is taking pictures and videos from our social media sites to create ""new"" content.  Who owns our pictures?  Do you want your 6 year old's stomach used to create Child Pornography?  Because that's what's happening.  Don't believe me?  Ask AI to put two celebrities together to create a ""new"" picture.  AI can't because Celebrities have rights/lawyers.  We normal folks do not."
0:34-0:35  her Left leg becomes her Right leg -- that's some flexible AI
Someone needs to remake that will smith eating spaghetti video from sora
Well its enough scary with this AI images...i must look and think  twice when i look  a picture on facebook or twitter... and the way the reality is twisted now OMG...everything is so beautiful ...perfect...like i know now why that dude in the Matrix movie wants to go back in the simulation...just because real world looks like shit compared to AI world...and its all just starting...üôÑüò≥

"Every technology is worst than it's ever gonna be, iPhone 15 is the worst iPhone it's ever gonna be. But all tech until now was evolutionary whereas AI is revolutionary...!!"
Why when you type in man only white man show up.
"Wow, your final thought. All of humanity's inventions have evolved from those that have come before. Now with AI that evolutionary process is shrinking. Soon it'll be like travelling a light year in the blink of an eye. It's exciting and disconcerting to dream about the reality where we are headed."
"You are human and you have been trained by a few humans. Why do you think, AI trained by so many more,  will not be better than you? At the end, you have to rely on your charisma, aura, charme or whatever secret ingrdience."
U really like that will smith video hahahaha
WHO CARES ABOUT AI IT'S CURSED
"We used to think humans were special for being able to create works of art, yet AI proves that you don't have to be conscious or aware in order to do so. That almost indicates to me that we ourselves are just complex input-output machines at the end of the day whether we want to admit that or not. Same goes for language creation too tbh. AI's can create coherent sentences without being aware or conscious of it. Being able to talk isn't proof you are a conscious thinking being. Nor is being able to create a work of art. So what even IS proof you are a conscious being? Maybe there isn't any, maybe it's all a big illusion."
I really hope that it could be banned in countries upto some extent
"Elon Musk warned us all. In the VERY near future, you won't even be able to submit video evidence into a court case. AI needs to be shut down. Humanity is NOT ready for it."

This was an amazing video. It made me realize how much AI is about to change everything!
somebody should write down their dreams in a journal and give ai the prompt and see how ai reconstructs it in a  video. That would be so crazy to see. Then we would know if ai sees our dream similar to how we saw it when we dreamt
"My fear is AI being used to incriminate innocent people. The ""truth"" will be what those in power choose it to be."
This will be a boon to Psy-Ops. We will never know what is real and what is propaganda designed to control society/us.

So be careful what you are wishing for, as good intentions may be taken as downloading your desires to create false schemes..."

"Nice relaxing video man, subbed!"
I can finally make my dreams into a video. My scripts when I was a kid into a video. It will be just another tool for future story tellers and creative minds. We can all be directors.
"Irritates me just how few people understand what AI is! 
These videos are not generated solely by AI - all the AI is doing (as with the language AI progs) is taking images and videos from an ever increasing and vast library and manipulating them to fit the data. These videos are not built from the ground up by AI - as you all seem to imagine. The term AI is misleading. This is like calling Google artificial intelligence for turning text intro images (via image search). This goes one step further is all - by creating images that may not have existed before - by combining many different mediums."
make the better ai make a will smith video again.
Do you guys think this technology invented in 2023-2024 ? :D At least 10-20 years

Hey i am big fan i follow you also Facebook
Imagine how easy it will be to incriminate someone üòÆ
I'm here to support you! ü•∞
Like i called years ago people will be able to make any movie they want or edit a existing movie were the story is slightly different or way can't wait to create some but sadly i truly believe the movie business will go under as a lot of other entertainment and actors without jobs it's going to get real nutty so prepare yourselves
I don't believe that that was the real MB. This MB was Ai generated.
"Throughout history, what destroys mankind will always be created by mankind with the thought process of advancement, productivity and self protection. Nuclear missiles, guns, jet fighters, war ships,now AI. Of course, they will say its for advancement but they never tell you the other side of what it can do. Like human beings never learn from the past, not even their own movies which clearly shows how this is going to end."
What is google going to do about. ü§îü§î
"Like anything else, there are things that technology cannot beat. Millions of years of evolution, and humans are still the best at telling stories (and probably the only species on the planet to do so). AI can take the formula and make a story of it, but it can never understand archetypes. I love writing stories and what AI has given me now is a new, more visual way of telling my stories so that they can be read by more people. Ai enhances creativity, AI can never replace it."
"The wtf moment for me it was with the one that has the reflections on the tokyo train. If you know anything about vfx or actually making videos in general, you would know that making that with a real camera is actually impossible without puting hours in editing to take the camera out of the the reflection. (Sorry for my english, I'm working on it)"

Dude this technology needs laws to be applied. Videos must not use any human likeness cg generated voices etc illegal. The use can only be for stock footage and can only comprise of less than 10% of principle photography in videos. This is a power grab. We cannot lose touch with being human. This is just insane. Truly no idea is original anymore if this continues. What is human.

"For those trying to put down the concerns of videographers/photographers/artists, etc. Do you think those building these generative algorithms are going to stop at photos, illustrations, and videos? No. The people helming these business endeavors are going to (if not actively doing so already) look at replacing your profession too. I don't care if you're a sales person, in customer support person, or a brain surgeon, someone at the top is going to use generative algorithms to where you're going to need fewer and fewer people in that industry. This will go until there isn't a viable market for any of those sorts of jobs.

So if you are struggling with empathy towards videographers/photographers/artists, etc., I ask you to show some empathy and look a little further down the road. You'll want a more empathetic population for when your turn eventually comes."
"Also, on ""training on videos"": You know, there is a reason why you cant just do that? Not that big data would care about privacy concerns and laws, but .. there are still a few laws .. and reasons. Like ""all videos"" would also include your private moments of joy, of yourself, maybe some nudes, maybe your children .. 

.. yeah, there is that."
"Yeah, ""AI"". Can we maybe at least call it ""Generative AI""? Which is still an extreme euphemism. Generative IA would be correct. There is no intelligence at work. Its just all learning matrixes, and cleverly crafted, ""intelligent"" algorithms.

Which, taken by itself, is truely a huuuge evolution.

Still, no Artifical Intelligence involved :)"
Think about how much people are already manipulated by media. The crazy thing is that in the future we just won't know what is real and what isn't anymore unless we see it with our actual eyes. And that opens up the door for a LOT of manipulation.
Good to come to terms with God‚Äôs offer of forgiveness through Christ‚Äôs death on the cross for our sins.  Ai will deceive many and possibly one day ask us to worship it.  Starting to be convinced this may be the turn towards the end of times.
"3 days ago
The really scary thing is that these videos are just a by-product of their real intention which is to give AI the ability to recognise the world around it. So basically they will be using this for  autonomous vehicles and robots and these machines will be able to adapt to all of their environments. I'm thinking ten years before Tesla's Optimus is as good if not better than a human at  doing most things."

Newsflash: this video was made by ai too
The dogs playing blew my mind the most
"Is it cgi, or is it virtual effects.

Is the AI creating everything, or does it use real photo assets and just modifies them?

Like is the AI truely creating all of it from scratch. Or is it adjusting information already there.

Does it create the person from scratch, or take a picture of a person already out there and use that. Cgi vs virtual effects.

I believe, to truly say ai created it, it has to all be cgi. No real photos used. Otherwise it's just settings you adjust to get the product you want. It doesn't actually create, just streamlines the process of the artist doing the creating.

The one in the city, it looked like cgi extras, but the main girl I'd say was a real photo they wrapped around a cgi/motion suit model.

I'm willing to bet, extra things not mention went into those videos.

I dont see this as AI creating things. I see it as another program that helps the artist streamline the process.

Just as when photoshop and other programs allowed artist to expand what they could do by streamlining certain processes, this ai does the same.

Photo of dog in woods, I could completely make it from scratch, or I can use programs and photos already out there to make it easier, or I can use ai to make it very easy. It's a tool to use to make things easier, not an entity that can create on its own

IMO.

But I could be wrong, maybe if you open up photo shop, no outside assets, (photos, motion suit, ect.) the Ai would create this from scratch. Idk about that though, they'd probably end up like the extra in the background, maybe a little better.

It's crazy how science FICTION can controll our fears.

Ai will never have the ability to do us harm, no more than a gun can. It will 100% be how people use this tool that will cause harm."

Or like others commented, eventually we won't be able to tell what's real and what isn't.."

"Yall overreacting as always. Its in your dna to be scared. Like when they said that the world is not the center. Like when they developed WLAN.

Like we came this far and didnt think of a button to stop or unveil the truth/lie. Whats next, stop all electronics cuz they could explode? Everyones scared like anything's ever gonna affect you, trust me even if you were that important the truth will always prevail, there will always be a chance to prove, to stop AI."
Artificial intelligence is gonna be very toxic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that one thing some or most people dont understand is that they think AI is uncreative, bacause all it does is take what humans have done then compile combine and repeat. But they dont realise that humans learn the exact same way. You learn from your teachers, you get inspiration from the works from others, inspiration from observing the natural world and the environment around you. I could be wrong, but i believe that no work done by humans has been entirely original. It just does not seem possible. To draw a tree for example, you have to observe a tree in the real world, maybe look at pictures, then maybe look at other artists' works and learn and emulate their style or learn from a teacher. Then you replicate. AI is doing the exact same, but way better and faster. You cannot learn without a teacher (be it another human, or something inanimate as in nature), and you cannot create without inspiration and reference."
"As AI tools are increasing, the demand for AI jobs will be extremely high. For example, ""Prompt Engineers"" who are able to communicate with AI engines perform tasks and are able to communicate with AI engines will be in high demand. Also, this job will be extremely in high demand for companies around the world and even for government cyber defense agency, which is ""Turing test Specialist."" The job task is to be able to detect AI generated content like deep fake and fake text messages, and even more. The turing test was first seen in the movie ""Blade Runner"""

"This is a breakthrough in media production technology.It's going to cut time in half for producing a project. I think that it will be instrumental in implementing AI into pre production and story boarding. It will also be useful in developing a fundamental idea of a movie into an actual film or short. Copywrighting will not be the same in our future with AI involved in generating everything, but AI is going to have to share the credit because would it be able to be generated without a human actually putting in the words and imagining the idea? Cant give AI all the credit but it's a technological breakthrough that is defining the times we live in. Who would of thought in 2000 that we would see this in 2024.  To me this is an amazing advancement, it will have its' drawbacks, but I'm interested in seeing how much better it can get."

"also everyone whos brazenly saying braindead things like "" drone pilots and concept artists are overpaid"" are clearly unable to comprehend the complexity of this situation. with no cinematographers, theres no need for camera manufacturers, which means less need for materials manufacturing. theres a chain effect. all so one person can make mediocre content for free that nobody has money to pay for since they wont have jobs. so in the end, who even wins? nobody."
"what gets me about AI is how people have been screaming at the top of their lungs about the potential downfalls, and now theyre acting suprised. im sure when it gets inevitably used to further fake news and cause some kind of political catastrophe, we will still be scratching our chins and pretending we didnt see it coming, or outright denying it."
"We're definitely NOT a long way for full movies whatsoever. In a year that was a drastic improvement. It's only going to get worse... This technology replaces jobs and seems to be the primary goal for creating it. AI can be useful for small businesses and teams who do not have funding, or a team of skilled professionals, and need help with things such as stock video etc for their projects.. However, it will never be a fair and ""one size fits all"" solution, so therefore it should be immediately banned overall. This technology offers ZERO contribution to the human race overall."
"What worries me is that ""pioneers"" of AI will make or fund something like this and just keep going, I don't know if it's ignorance, denial, or some mix of both, but it's at the point now where it's too late to stop its progress so all that can really be done is damage control"

Ignore my talking. Just look at the numbers in Noah‚Äôs ark, and the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Just look at the numbers. So he is the Lord and he change it not.

If it is trained on all videos but uses a combined approach on a small enough scale in relation to the elements which are used from each video in its library, at some point that's got to be more original than even human creativity which is often inspired by others resulting in mimicry, tribute, copying/plagiarism etc."

This can only end in the downfall of capitalism or a dystopian future where there is no escape from rampant manipulation by the powerful."
"well, if you watch closely enough, there are few things that can say that it was AI-generated. For example, look at the way how the legs are moving in the clip starting at 0:32 - the movement is not natural, sometimes I would say that it's impossible to move them like that.
That doesn't mean it couldn't get any better in the near or far future, I just want to say that you can still recognize the generated footage due to these little nuances - it's the same as ""five finger problem"" for AI generated pictures, where people have more or less than five fingers, almost always weirdly screwed up."

Because there will be AI cyber attacks on banks and pension funds and its when they lose not if. When was the last time you printed your accounts off? What if you can't access your accounts anymore AI has debanked you. There is no record of you at the bank, no loan, no savings, no pension like you never existed. Most of your information is saved on the web browsers, keyboard logged on what you type its online for every. Those apps you log into have your data saved they can copy you. your photos online they can make deep fakes of you."
"Although I agree the tech is improving by leaps and bounds, you can't get away from the uncanny valley effect still. It takes a whole of a split second to notice... The only similar phenomenon in real life is when you meet someone who has had a plastic surgery.

EDIT: I believe the real problem is how perfect it tries to be, real life is not so perfect, the brain does not accept it. Perhaps it needs more chaos, more randomity, a different set of a complex RNG system. Otherwise humans will forever experience the Neo effect (matrix). 

There is an instinctive emotional response that is triggered by such imagery, but most humans have been conditioned by excessive exposure to audio visual stimulation."

"I feel like ""this is the worst these videos will look from now on"" is a good way to think about it but it can deceive how much progress is actually being done. As you said, these are hand-picked examples. It is very clear that these videos have limited framing (in the sense that they replicate professional video framing). And that's very much unlike what you can do with images. We can already make images from prompts, so a video superimposing those images over already existing types of videos isn't as big of a revolution. It is also not clear how easy would be to make the same jump into ""different framings"". It may take years to polish for all we know.

I'm guessing that the model is not widely available because it will completely break in the same way early DALL-E did when faced with unexpected framing."

"I have a theory for how AI is gonna be like in the future.

Right now, AI takes videos that humans made and outputs a video that is very similar. Emphasis on ""Right now"".

If AI keeps growing as much as it is now, then eventually there will be so many AI videos on the internet that the AI will end up using its own videos to generate new ones. And I feel like this'll have a degradation effect like copying the same VHS over and over again, or uploading, downloading, and reuploading the same video on YouTube over and over again. It'll probably take a really long time, but the quality will be degraded so much that AI will basically end up back at the beginning. THEN we'll need those photographers and editors again.

So if AI ends up taking all of our jobs, then it probably won't be that way forever."

"i think CGI will be in the past very soon.. forget 3D engines. when you can literally TYPE your movie script and it'll do the filming for you... sheesh.. this is scary but awesome,,, also i'll add that i don't think Ai will replace filming.. filming is one thing ai is another.. they can live together.. because me myself i enjoy going out and to film something i saw myself .. second thing is to create something from text... i think they're totally different things .."
"I have several issues with this.  As a viewer, first of all, I didn't like what I saw.  I mean I didn't enjoy it.  It was not pleasing or entertaining to me in an artistic sense.  I am so used to good animation and film drawing me in, making me want to watch more.  None of these did that.  There is a lack of the human element.  My concern is that in the AI's wake, less human, artistically pleasing content will be generated.  But furthermore this content has been created by scraping other human copyrighted works.  I believe what AI is doing is unethical.  Currently it is allowed to do so without the permission or payment to the original creators.  This has to stop. People should be paid for their work and allowed to opt out of it being used for these purposes.  This is true with all AI.  I don't care what kind of art or even ""data""  you create, permission and payment should be under any human creators control.  Right now it is like the wild west out there, but laws should be drafted and put to use to end the exploitation of the human element that is necessary for these AI creations to exist."

how do i know you're not AI?
Fuck did you have to show that nightmare fuel of will smith that many times lol
does this mean paul walker will be in the fast and ferious movies?
"The kid sitting in the clouds reading a book: look at his upper arm. Unless he has an illness that keeps him from being as active as a normal kid his age, there should be more muscle tone there for a boy. Otherwise, it does look really well. To me that was a give away."
"Plot Twist - this tech has been around a really long time, only being revealed to the public now, and they're going to tell us that most of today's ""actors"" aren't even real. Or perhaps all of this is real footage (which maybe they've purposefully degraded a bit to provide ""evidence"" that it's AI), and we're merely being told it's AI, and since you and I can't actually touch the tech, and can only rely on stories about it and videos alleging to show it, we will believe it's actually AI."
Watch out guys... We're all about to start noticing a lot more UFO's and other paranormal activities in our daily lives but no one will bother recording footage because people will just think it was an AI generated video.
But we can't cure cancer smh
"We're seriously gonna have to regulate these things. Google made the internet seemingly omniscient, now it's becoming omnipotent. These things should be tools for the general population to improve upon their lives, not to create a gigantic monopoly of a corporation that replaces jobs."
"Ya, prompt it to eat spaghetti and see how far it HASN'T come. We were close to these types of videos when the Will Smith video came out. The only impressive one is the girl walking but again, the hands and face moving in the video are still a no-go for AI. 

The snow on the puppies looks like asbestos... and add in the media poison people are adding to their artwork to ruin AI neural networks. It's already happening and people are asking for one thing and given an absolutely wrong thing, it's media producers poisoning their art for AI.

Also waiting on some designer to pop up and claim the video used by AI is from their work."
Trust but verify. I guess.

"Creative is literally all it is. Sure it needs prompts,, but  that's it. It will improve itself using ml algos. It's not out of thin that air they are generated but out of real images people have created. The algo combines them to make its own unique images, but they are essentially copied (if not used directly, a few pixels from one here, a few more from another there, and so on) from the work of many real people who shot the stuff they feed into their software."
"What people and companies like the owners of these software are ignoring, is that these videos plagiarize real content we took and uploaded, and garbled it together to create these videos. We aren't being paid. Last I heard, if you take images like from shutterstock or Canva, and compile multiple images to create new ones, you have to pay fees for the work you used. We aren't being paid. They're stealing from the public. Who's going to stop that one?

"This is not crazy. This is criminal. AI is nothing but theft, theft of digitized intellectual property, which it uses to mashup a slightly different image. it‚Äôs only cheap because it‚Äôs stolen.

I think some people should balance out their thought processes and realize the world will at the same time benefit in various ways in the same respect as the negatives imply.  Everything has its ups and downs but the great thing about humans is we always find a way to adapt to change. Don't forget the fact that these changes are all coming into play because of the power of the human brain in the 1st place.

"As a production company, this sucks. Time to switch to full time Documentary film making. Cant AI that."
"In the video of the grandma, she went to blow out the candles and they stayed lit"
"You may have been left with a bit of fear after watching this video. For me, it‚Äôs all about getting up-skilled first and learning as much as possible about this beast, in order to understand it better. 

Don‚Äôt be scared. The future is inevitable."
"As a social science/humanities person, I am obviously critical of AI, but this - AI-made videos - is on another level. Imagine a future where you enter Instagram, TikTok, or even YouTube, and you cannot tell whether the content you consume was made with AI. This is problematic for two main reasons.

Firstly, we are already in the media overconsumption era. An average person spends more than an hour daily on social media, usually for entertainment. Having AI-made videos so easily accessible would make ten times more content a day personalized for each user if not more. What if big corporations like Meta were to buy this video creator AI-s? They could generate their own ""original"" content.

Secondly, small artists and content creators already feel pressured to put out more fresh content a few times a week, if not every other day. If AI were to be part of their new competition, these people could be easily forced out of the game."
People tend to forget the main reason we have entertainment industries and that is to entertain people and not to make people rich. lol.
These Ai Images and videos have better quality than many current shows and movies üòÖ
"I really am trying to think of how the good that this technology can do could possibly outweigh the negatives and I just can not do it. Deep fake pornography, ai generated video evidence of politicians doing things they never did, the destruction of so many jobs in the sphere of filmmaking. For me, going through the internet has become more stressful in trying to understand what is ai genrrated and what is made by people, and now we are getting close to a point where it might be impossibly to tell without serious examination. Imagine a future, say a couple of years, where every video, every single video that you see no matter how real it looks, could be ai generated. Really, why does this technology need to exist? Is it really worth it, just so we can generate content quicker and with less/no work? Who does this actually serve? Why do we need this? I'm genuinely curious."
Does this mean Avatar 3 is going to come out before James Cameron starts filming it?
but the will smith video was real he eats spagetti like that.....
The possibilities are endless!
Its all virtual inteligence and not AI but already it will destroy many work places. Ofcourse its also great chance but in reality virtual inteligence will be able replace huge amount of work places.
The really scary thing is that these videos are just a by-product of their real intention which is to give AI the ability to recognise the world around it. So basically they will be using this for  autonomous vehicles and robots and these machines will be able to adapt to all of their environments. I'm thinking ten years before Tesla's Optimus is as good if not better than a human at  doing most things.
This is really cool and frightening.

"It seems to me that after every new technology there's a war. The war that follows AI is going to be epic.

For any soldier on the battlefield be able to tell whether he is receiving real orders or not? What about the guy with his finger on the nuclear button?"
Hard truth. AI movies peaked at Smith eating spaghetti.
"This is unfolding in horror movies sci-fi horror future ai is what this is. 

iRobot shit 


I‚Äôm becoming a farmer and stay with real shit fuck this"
Yeah! Now the ai is very advanced!
"I don't think it's far-fetched to expect full-length videos (or even an ""episode"" of something) generated entirely by AI in the next 5 years. Considering we've gone from ""Weird Will Smith eating spaghetti fever dream"" to ""undetectable to the untrained eye"" in just 12 months, it's well within the possibility that by 2029, AI will be able to generate video with sound and it be indistinguishable from the real thing. 

I think a more profound impact this will have is on the film and television industry. For several years now both film and telly have suffered from ""uninspired remake garbage"" or ""prequel to the sequel to the sequel to the sequel."" There are millions of viewers/fans out there that will be able to describe a story to AI and have it generate an entire movie or television episode. A new episode of Doctor Who in 1975 style, for example. 

I can't stress enough how much this is going to fundamentally change the entertainment industry. AI will grant anyone the ability to produce a full-length movie based on their own stories. No studio contracts, no licensing fees, no distribution rights, no actors, directors, or production crews. 

It's even possible that within 15 years, AI will render the film industry obsolete. We are on the eve of a MAJOR paradigm shift of human society - one as pivotal as the advent of the automobile or the invention of writing."
Sora did a great job on Marques' hands but his lips were out of sync with voice audio.

Can't wait till people start tampering with video and photo evidence with AI and fuck up people's lives.

Can't wait to witness all the mayhem it will cause once released to the public.
What‚Äôs worrisome is that not everyone sees the concern of how fast AI is developing. I understand that it can seem ‚Äúconspiracy theory esque‚Äù but there are actually some REAL concerns about this that should be acknowledged LOL.

we are in the endgame now
"Flat earthers will have far more content, holocaust deniers, climate change deniers, amout of issues Myanmar faced with facebook fake news, now you will have videos confirming your fears and instigate reactions....

We are doomed cause what we want to improve is not the issue of solving real problems but to make something to appease the masses.... Valuations be damned, what are we solving for?"
"This is actually not good, we are advancing way too quickly for us to handle!! Already we had issues of fake news and now it's going to go to another level...

For content creators it's scary no doubt, but in general also it's not giving confidence in what it's solving for!!"
"AI is not what you think it is its way beyond all of this, real AI is like a delicate flower that produces whatever fragrance you like, this is just computers when real AI comes your see its more beautiful than you can ever imagine."
"I am kinda exited about AI but at the same time, no. You see with AI we could improve the ability to work hours and hours without having humans to do it or wait for the next shift so the other comes  to take the shift. Companies would not have to pay employees  because AI will be great to replace works, also bad for people who may lost their jobs because of it. Companies would have more $, not working overnight, Ai could work at any time when you want them to work, because they will never get fired by doing such job, but a lot of jobs would cut off, companies would start replacing people for machines so they wont have to be sitting all shift answering calls, robots or any sort of AI will take the advantage of never getting tired, except in the Fire Department or hospitals were fast tinker might act quickly than any robotic system. So that's my take I don't know how to feel in AI."

"2Dai is a crypto competitor of Sora, if you buy it now might change your life !"
I thought Will Smith was 100% AI now?
"I'm not into technical AI stuff, but it didn't surprise me - it seems very predictable to me that it was supposed to be this way. It just makes me wonder if companies like OpenAI should be working and wasting time on censorship - because I think that in the future you will be able to generate much better videos on your own computers anyway."
The will smith videos will give me nightmares im sure.
"Awesome and scary, but seriously if anyone can point me towards what I can use to make something like the Will Smith eating spaghetti, I'd be immensely grateful. I would love to leverage that nightmarish look intentionally. I would make the stuff of nightmares. Someone help me make this happen!"
4 years from now(maybe less) AI will be used to creat whole movies

"19th century the people ran away from the b/w train films because they thought it is real. Don't underestimate our brain, it will adapt and we will be able to spot the differences maybe faster than we think.
Also the trick about cinematography is, that it can't be prompted via text. It is the directors and DOPs interpretation that makes the whole charme. The key is that it is not perfect, that it is made by humans. Obviously this will kill a lot of jobs for some time, thats for sure..."
"I worked for film critic Roger Ebert years ago and he would not read screenplays or comment on them,  in case somebody would use his words or the fact he read something as a promotion of their film product. One of the first to take advantage of this sort of thing was Walt Whitman writing in his own preface that Emerson loved his ""Leaves of Grass"" when Emerson did not approve of this or say that. We've come a long way baby. As I reach for a cigarette. What will become of copyright law?"
"Write a detailed movie script to be generated on the fly by a massive data center and played live in cinemas. Each time the movie is shown, it will vary slightly and give different experience."

"Deception was always about having a trusted source anyway. The reality is convincing photoshop was a thing 20 years ago, and it didn't change all that much.

"And in reverse, from this year videographic documents will become at least ""doubtable"" in politics as any politician now can claim that the footage of him or her caught saying something controversial in public is ""fabricated"" with AI by his or her enemies. Video proof will be ""doubtable"" as any footage used as ""proof"" of something either politically, academically or legally now has to pass multiple inspection even data decryption to be verified as geniune. It is not that fabrication of videographic proof is something new. We were been doing that all the time. However, it never had been so easy that everyone who is willing to pay gets its done so professionally."

to be honest Marques...we need people like you now more than ever informing the public about AI...what to watch for. It is going to be tech voices like yours that help shape and navigate this transition.
kwebellkop is gonna be DROOLING
We actually need to just stop developing this - the negatives far out way the positives. When the negatives include misinformation that could over throw a government and the positives are stock footage for ads we need to ask ourselves why are we doing this.
This is dangerous. What if there is an AI generatered video of you killing someone. And used in court as evidence ü§î
Where does this all lead?ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇ Great video and thoughts Marques

"For now, there are telling 'qualities' that occur in AI generated videos that queue that they are AI generated (weird, slight transitions with objects for example).  I'm sure that there were much more advanced generated videos that will fool the most seasoned of video editors that we (general public) have no clue about."
This channel creates our subscribe by fraud method
I personally don't feel that it's that big of a leap here. It's just more power and little bit of tunning thrown in but fundamentally it's same thing as it was 3 years ago it's just 3 years ago nobody has thrown as many expensive GPUs into the problem as they did for this one. Essentially it's same shit but higher resolution. Fundamentally it's flawed and it cannot improve based on it's current architecture. It can increase resolution by throwing even more hardware but it's still going to be flawed in exactly same way.
"I'm curious to understand the shift in Marques' content strategy regarding AI. He seemed quite reserved on the subject in 2023, and now there's a noticeable increase in AI-related posts. Is this change due to a deepened understanding of AI, or is he exploring the topic more thoroughly now?"

"Movies could possibly be made by AI using books as a source. The first process would be to use an AI to convert a book into screen plays for one or more movies. Requirements for direction style, lighting style, etc. would also be used as inputs to the first stage. The screen plays would then be fed into other AIs to produce all of the scenes in the final movies."

As an AI video creator I can safely say that nobody will be a genius film maker overnight because of Sora as it‚Äôs not just about putting clever little films together it‚Äôs about direction and creating a piece of art. No doubt Sora is a powerful tool but so are Ferraris and people who can afford them still crash them as they don‚Äôt know how to harness the cars power nor do they respect it enough to care. Look past the fickle nature of AI and you will see its majesty.

"You know what is funny. You are scared about the videos that could be generated, while you actually see people believing EVERYTHING without ANY actual proof. What the hell you think will change? What the hell you think will change????"
"Those puppies playing in the snow could be real, nobody would ever know it wasn't. You could tell someone it was fake and I think you'd have a hard time convincing them of it. The physics seem to be one of the only things that still kind of give some of them away sometimes, anytime you see someone moving it often feels a little floaty and slightly off. But as mentioned, it's already 100% good enough to pass as real footage if you aren't specifically looking for the flaws - and this is *without* any editting. With a VERY minimal amount of effort you could just edit most of these videos slightly differently to mask any little flaws. Even if these are very cherry-picked examples, only the best of the best, if all you have to do is hit ""generate"" a bunch of times and maybe modify the prompt a little you could make whatever you wanted in no time at all.

I'm insanely excited for the creativity this stuff will allow, lots of art is often prohibitively expensive for people starting out to afford, be it for video games or for cinematic ideas they have, and this would make it so much more accessible. BUT, I'm also terrified of what on earth we're going to do here when we can no longer tell what is real and can't trust our eyes or ears anymore."
I bet the red teamers must have recreated the Will Smith video again with SORA
"Image generation is definitely limited in terms of what it can do from a novelty perspective. For example, for Christmas I tried to make a funny Zoom background, and I asked gpt-4 to generate a classic snowy outdoor Christmas scene, but for humor, have a sleigh in the night sky, pulled by eight tiny santas and manned by a reindeer. It couldn't do it! Over and over it would declare, Here it is, the Christmas seen with the humorous twist of Santas pulling the sleigh, but no amount of prompt reinforcement would get it to work. The closest I got was reindeer with Santa outfits on. A ways to go on novelty. (Thanks to Larry Niven & Steven Barnes in the book ""Dream Park"" for the idea, btw)."

That Smith‚Äôs video‚Ä¶ hurts harder than a face smack from him.
People in the background disappearing
Someone made a new AI version of Will Smith eating spaghetti and it is scary good
I don't feel myself real now.
This is a an ai generated video of Marques brownlee....if you slow the video to .25 you can see the inconsistencies of his hairline from one side to the other. You may duplicate this effect by using key words: wopsided bowl Goodluck!
"You guys just glossed over what this stuff is ""trained on"". Come on, this crap is going to blatantly rip off people's content and claim that it's ""generated"" for free."
"AI-generated video technology's leap in realism brings both creative opportunities and ethical challenges, highlighting the importance of safeguards against potential misuse."
"I feel like even with you being markedly impressed, every little jab about this or that being ""weird"" or ""off"" is just... almost futile if people are trying to extract some reassurance that ""don't worry, we are still a long way off.""""  Pixel peeping is right. The stock video industry could be toast soon with something like this."
"This is going to come with a massive amount of lives lost. When a stranger can destroy you socially with the push of a button, even have you incarcerated for a crime you never comitted, because he didn't like the way you looked at him on the subway. Not to mention the amount of fake prn with little to no control over what happens with your likeness once it's out there. Can't wait."
The moment you realize youre not real but AI generated.
One year from now he's going to reveal that actually this whole video itself was AI generated
Tucker Carlson Putin interview...
We need an analogue horror about AI
"Everything invented has potential of being used for good and bad, medicine, internet, television, etc. The number of job losses with Ai, and robots is going to be staggering.
But job losses, and Ai generated video will be the least of our problems."

"Plot twist:
Generate a Marques brown video reviewing Sora"
That older woman celebrating her birthday was uncomfortable. Something about it seemed off and  menacing.
"I remember in the past when new technology would come out we would get so excited about things like the new iPhone or this, or that. Now, especially with this video, it leaves me with an unsettled feeling in my gut. I don‚Äôt think this is going to Bodwell for the future of humanity."
"yeah we been talking about this at art school for a long time now, like years"
"You just scared me, honestly. That last statement got me shook"
Pixar sweating
"One other giveaway on these videos so far is that writing is nonsensical. The Japanese characters are wrong and make no sense. Probably why they picked a Japanese street as it's not as obvious to people who don't read Japanese (or Chinese) characters. But I guess that's something that will just get worked into the models going forward.

The other thing that might be challenging using these models for longer form video is consistency of characters across multiple video scenes. Like you can ask it to generate a random woman walking down the street. But if you want it to use that exact same woman in another scene later it might be hard to do that at the moment."
"not very special, I do this shit for a living.
I code that shit. That is pretty normal shit"
"Boomers on FaceBook are fooled by Photoshop, no way this isn't going to trick those people. Between this and AI voices, it's going to be insanely easy to create video ""proof"" of people ""saying"" things they never actually said, or, on the flipside, there could be actual proof of someone saying something and they could just dismiss it as being ""AI generated."" Disinformation is going to get insane."
"your last statement is a little dumb, it will go far beyond the derivative baseline."
No need for Hollywood anymore
crazy stuff. Straight up kinda scary when you put certain types of TECH in peoples hands that use it for not so good stuff.  AI being one of them. Stumpr1
"Your out of biz really soon Marques,  Promp : ""Make me 500 Marques Brownlee styled youtube videos about different tech topics"" .  RIP youtube creators."
Im still concern that this video whether is real or ai generated...
"Very well analyzed and summarized.
The challenge in the future will be *to not fear AI* but to *capitalize on it and collaborate with it*."
"Will this hurt OF creators?

So, why wouldn't a person (man) create corn videos for OF and get the money instead of a real woman?"
"""it surely it can't be innovative or creative in ways that humans haven't already been, right?""

Wrong. It all depends on how you define ""innovative"", because if by that you mean ""unique"", we stopped  being creative and innovative as a species a long time ago. I mean, you aren't the first tech youtuber.

But if you define ""innovative"" in a more flexible way, then I see no reason why an AI cannot generate something we humans haven't done yet."
"I love how people think because an AI was trained on content created by humans it can't ever be more creative than us. Cause you know, everyone who ever has had a skill was born innately with it and didn't learn from or surpass anything any other human has ever done."
i loved that will smith video
6:10 the concern
"As an artist, I have lots of trouble drawing hands. I'm happy AI does as well.."
cool and scary
How long until AI can be applied to live streaming like a filter and add or remove elements and change dialogue?
Lets be honest its all gonna be porn
This is concerning and scary !!
This is scary for CCTV video and surveillance video that I collect as evidence for a police department. Am I going to have to prove in the future that certain clips have not been modified by AI? Changing the face of a murder suspect? Changing a handgun to something else? AI is going to perpetuate the downfall of humanity which has already started with the technological advances of the 21st century.
"It will not pass, they must have encoded in the metadata that this is AI generated"
Are we that naive to believe that we as public get aware of these technologies as aoon they come outüòÇwe only get to see them when they have it for minimum two decades already üòä
"You're going to go from artists to ""Prompt Artists"" who know how to squeeze every ounce of efficiency out of the AI to get the desired results in a decade or so.  My personal advice for people who are afraid of losing their current jobs?  Adapt."
"There's so much Face variations done by biology in such a way that no face looks the same(except for twins and others) YET AI can create it's own unique Face? Nah, I think someone is bound to look like the faces AI has uniquely created."
"AI might be bad for making us lose our Jobs, BUT I JUST REALLY LOVE AI!!"
This whole video was AI. üòÇ
We are not very far away from watching completely AI Generated movies...
"Also really have mixed feeling. On one side it is very cool. Just imagine if almost everyone will be able to make blockbuster quality movies from home or old tv-shows and movies being redone by AI (like old style star trek, but then looks very epic). On the other hand it will probably not take long for it to not be recognizable from real stuff. Hope openAI also is doing something about that, becausr that could do a lot of damage."
"I was waiting for Marques to say at the end, that him in this video also was AI generated"
I can spot these fakes a mile away.  They still look like CGI animated movies to me.... which they are....
We can go to the moon again! :D
"Im surprised you didn't mention the woman's legs from the ai video. If you watch them as she walks, they... Rotate. A few times. Like, they swap places. Very freaky when you notice it."
"I don't think this is killing a bunch of jobs, more moving them. This is going to open at least as many creative doors as it closes. Not everyone has the budget or the resorces or the talent to make what they want. Just because you don't have the talent to make say an animated video does not mean you have nothing interesting you would like to make. I think this could open up the arts to a lot of people. I'm excited to see what they make."
"You can just say one year, not ""literally"" one year.  A year is a year."
I love how you meme will smith. Is it for how he said your name. Or the slap.
"The worry here with an election coming up, is this could be used to confuse and mislead the general public when it comes to false information?"
"1 year from now? Nah, it might be lesser than that. either way, i'll be waiting for your video. have a great one Marques"
Someone with decent editing skills could easily make a movie putting a hundred 1 minute videos together

I'm genuinely scared...
"In 5  years nobody can tell if a photograph or a video is real. I guarantee that we will no longer be able to tell the difference. 
The world will change, photographers and filmmakers will have to dress warmly. 
I think it's better to slowly learn other skills like: Growing your own food"
"We have the incorrect view of AI and automation - every time ""machines"" wipe out jobs, a large portion of the profits generated through tech should go towards paying people displaced by the tech, because, ultimately, most jobs will be so displaced.  If we don't change our economic model, we'll be left with a few hundred thousand people owning EVERTHING and the other 8 billion of us begging on the streets (or, more likely, starving on the streets).  Every advancement is built upon past knowledge and so should be viewed as the common property of all mankind.  The goal would be to remove the drudgery from our lives and allow everyone to live their most fulfilling lives, paid for by automation that frees up our time."
"The thing that blew my mind was that california gold rush footage. You notice how the camera shakes and vibrates? Yeah that perfectly mimics unstabilized footage taken from an actual helicopter, as would have been the case with that shot back in the day."
Don't deny it! We all know the first thing we thought of when we heard/saw about this üòè
"Damn just imagine the potential in a few years. Entire movies and series can be created with this, let alone social media accounts who will be run (and represented) by ai"
Hormozi did a great video of all what is to come with AI. adapt or die.
DAMG!
The old ai will smith video is just like my dreams that make no sense and the way everything just not perfect and bad just my dream and i see it as a normal dream
"We're probably already living in such AI-simulated ""matrix""... P.S. AI must be prohibited legally. Period."

‚ÄúPixel-peeking‚Äù. Love it! Will an AI ever be able to generate and narrate a YouTube video as nicely as MKBHD does? ü§î
I wonder if anyone has thought to import and entire E-book into video AI and create a movie?
Imagine if he ended with the phrase 'this video is also AI generated'
Writing scenario for the movie and putting it into AI.
It would be cool to make a short movie using this. That is supposed to be a dream/a nightmare. And the weird artifacts would definetly add to the atmosphere
"This video is jumping out whenever I open YT page. It is so annoying that I'm not going to watch video at all. I usualy love Marques's videos, but this is realy too much. Sorry Marques, I don't like things being forced on me!"
we might not need actors ... comming years
"Hi,

I recently sent my watch in for a battery service as it was 84% and I wanted to service it to 100%.

I was informed this is not possible with the watch or with any other apple products. 

Can you please make a video and inform others about the issue, and maybe convince apple to change their policy?."
Willis not a cool guy
"hopefully i will be able to see a real android in my life, something like in the game ""Detroit: Become Human"", at least something similar, but then there's a weird thing, even tho those are machines made by humans, those machines have ""their"" own mind and decisions, just like humans"
yeah we're absolutely done.
am I the only one waiting for Marques to reveal that his facecam was generated too?
The Death of Creativity. Peak Creative Theft.
"2025: Anyone can prompt a full movie script with voices/music description for each character, and get a full length movie/animation generated probably in a few hours. Brace yourself."

"Hello ,

My name is Aakif and I'm from Kashmir, India. Your YouTube channel is very interesting and informative. I would like to dub your videos in Hindi and English so that more people in India can access your tech and AI related content. 

I was thinking I could take your original videos and edit them a bit, like using an animated AI character in place of you when you are speaking. That way I won't have to alter your voice to sound like a girl's.

If you give me permission, I would love to try dubbing and sharing your videos. I will credit your channel with my edits. I think your videos could help many people in Hindi too.

Please let me know if you're okay with me dubbing and sharing your content in this way. I'm a big fan and would love to help make your videos more accessible. Looking forward to your reply!

Thank you,
Aakif"
Is that guy being used on the cloud a real individual??
Don't worry about politicians... they will all be replaced by AI
Can‚Äôt wait for some hidden genius to make a great movie one day.
"I was hoping for this video to end like: ""This video is AI generated""üòÖ"
This is very sad.
Movies won't need human actors in the future.
Plot twist: at the end he reveals that this entire video was AI generated
Welcome to lets fake everything world.
this will be great for horror movies/visuals. i‚Äôm ready to see full on nightmares
2-3 more years and you will not know anymore whats true and whats fake that is nuts to me .
"Look a documentary edit board for a Ken Burns video, its all prompted selections to go with the narration and narrative. This would be great for that ... any story telling. I am sure your videos often need a ""lets find some stock footage"" ... waste time finding the right stock footage ... here you can spend some time making the footage and have that resource to go back to and mine it.

I am very excited for this.

Look at the costs for a movie ... people, places, things ... a horrible fixed set of acts and never allowing for certain actor combinations ... etc ... now you can have those actors in places they cannot / won't be, age radically, etc ... STTNG ... but in TOS motif ... sure yeah ... do it.

I see this more akin to what handheld 4K minicams and then phones did for video, made it accessible and people like yourself are empowered from it.

Especially when you use the ""AI assistant tools"" that will help you establish a shot, frame and pan properly, balance focuses, give you massive reshoots, give you impossible angles, etc."
Nobody can defeat the AI tide thats coming
Crazy yes and yes there will be soon Human-made Videos and Human-made Images like the handmade products now. All the others will be done by AI.
"I think this is going to be very good over all. I mean, especially for indie documentation type video essays. Want to demonstarte something to your audience that isn't able to be easily replicated irl and you also dont want to spend fifteen days modelling a scene in blender? just ask AI. Sure, there's going to be a lot more cheaply produced shit and bad copypaste videos, but it's not like bad content doesn't already exist."
Here's what I always thought: your videos are AI-generated
It‚Äôs been a fun run youtubers. Now you can rest in peace. AI is here.
Mind blown ü§Ø
People with bad intentions are getting a lot of useful tools
The problem is that too many good and bad people are jumping on the bandwagon at once. Are we going to create our own AI for ourselves and not jump to AI just because corporations made them.
"What's really freaking *me* out is that the exact same things that AI's have a hard time generating are things that *we* have a hard time generating in our dreams. Literally looking at your hand is one of the most reliable ways to realize you are in a dream. If you make it a habit in your daily life to look at your hands you will also become a lucid dreamer, because you will start looking at your hands in your dreams and realize you are in a dream."
if you look closely you can see @ 2:23 to 2:26 her left leg will change to her right leg
Welp...  We're fucked
"Image of the Beast 
Holy Bible 
Revelations"
"In the current world, you just need to know what you want, everything will be done by technology!!!"
.. AI is just fine.  Its the people that are fucked..
We need verifiable metadata watermarks when this is released.
"Look back in a year like, ‚ÄúRemember when we all had jobs?‚Äù"
i was expecting he'd eat spaghetti on a weird plate just to keep viewers guessing.
"I have read these verses for over 60 years and have wondered what in the future might rattle me enough to lean into these promises from the Bible. I feel, for me this moment is coming soon.
Romans 8:38-39 (New International Version)
38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[a] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
"Perhaps a law that forces a form of watermark on footage to be required on AI generated content could be passed to protect the jobs of artists. Especially commercial releases. Speaking from a working gaffer. We won't be able to stop advancements, but we should best adapt."
Will Smith recreated the ai video on his Instagram this week. its mad hilarious üòÇ
We need to see an updated version of Willy eating the spaget.
This entire video was actually the real MKBHD or just a video generated by Sorra?
Everybody over 45 already believes any decently photoshopped photo is real. This is basically magic to them. 0 chance of them ever realizing even if people tell them its generated.
"I love that you are always on the edge of new technologies!  But you don't have to worry about politicians fooling people with Sora. In fact, they always do this without any AI. But I think with Sora it would be another level of lying. For example, if some youtuber caught a politician doing something bad and showed that video, that politician might say that it wasn't me, Sora generated it! The way to deal with this was described in the Bible thousands of years ago - judge by the fruits! Don't listen to their explanations and excuses, just see whether you like the result or not. I think Hollywood should be worried about this technology because some person with a very good imagination can create a better movie than Hollywood, without actors, expensive equipment and so on, just using his computer. But on the other hand, we buy and see not always what is good, but what was sold to us! For example, our company has created and published software that is times better than Dall-e and can generate real greeting cards, postcards, invitations, etc., but no one knows about our app because we have no money, to pay Marques to tell people about our app!"
üôÅWish something made it so all advanced AI‚Äôs stopped working unless used for stuff like technical development and scientific research n stuff. I genuinely hate seeing every advancement in AI.
Not synthesised out of thin air. This was pirated from years of human media.
"And, at 2:35, watch her legs. She does two skips, then her left leg crosses over and impossibly becomes her right leg."
They most DEFINITELY had this for Years already... and they were using it... let that sink in ...
"... if they're just releasing this NOW... then they've been able to do it for over 5 years - it just hasn't been on a Commercial Level or Commercially Available - Now, think about that for a minute. Let that sink in. Who (three letter agencies) Funds These Companies? ... ""33"" does the AI know something and is trying to tell us? ... probably. Yes, Probably."
I know I'm not the Only One who saw that 33 was on dudes Helmet right?
I was waiting for the part where he says that the clips of him are ai generated lol
"just block any AI bros you come across
the nuclear option in a insane world is the most sane way to deal with that problem"
"Some famous films featuring artificial intelligence:

The world would be ROCKED if it was revealed Will Smith has actually eaten spaghetti.
This is a bizarre version of Jurassic Park.
I'm definitely getting a Totem
Can I make my own anime soon finally? That would be sick if I could make a whole ass anime narrative without a studio lmao
"Imagine asking it to make a movie from the written words of your favorite book.  It would just do the best it could... as accurate as it could.  No egos, no current politics.  Then add the next step... make Dune with a steampunk style.... it's really exciting."
"As someone who just started a drone videography business in the last two years this is more than slightly concerning üòÇ

It‚Äôs absolutely unreal how far visual generative AI has come in such a short time period! The future is gonna be wild ü§Ø"
Imagine this whole video is actually a I and it has been for Years and the whole internet is dead
"I understand the excitement behind not having to find ultra specific niche stock footage anymore but all of this is based on existing work that other cinematographers and location scouts and lighting engineers and countless others worked to create. I cant imagine anything but an eventual self sabotage. When all of the artists and creators who made this media in the first place are out of work and cant survive anymore, because their ingenuity and ability isnt valued at all in any capacity - what will be left for AI to scrape material off of? Will it just regurgitate its own ""created"" imagery? the same hapless broken shots and images, over and over ad infinitum? What happens when someone makes a video of you, endorsing products that you haven't experienced? Or makes a fake content creator and games the system to get more SEO? Where will you be when your ability to make and speak and feel and share that with the world - when your own individuality is tossed aside because a machine can plagiarize you for a fraction of your worth as a human?

This isnt a criticism of MKBHD specifically. AFAIK he's reporting on things he's interested in. Im just saying that theres a great deal of people who don't recognize these ""tools"" for their eventual intended purpose - to make capital profits at the expense of everything and everyone that exists, for as cheaply as possible."
Hey how do we know Marquese Brown is real?
At 7:44 there is a horse with two legs too hahahahhahaha
I am afraid teenage boys will do the worse using each other or their female classmates...
This is scary af if yall think deep into it
I hope they have some sense and don't make it public
"""Give me drone footage of a beautiful Icelandic landscape.""
AI: Super easy.
""Give me a hand waving.""
AI: Nah, I'm done."
It's definitely crazy and might cause bad actors to take advantage. Sometimes a solution creates a plethora of new problems. My rant apart: did anyone notice the leg switch at 2:25?
"i think we've seen a lot of stuff like that in the past, you just wouldn't know to questions authenticity because there wasn't talks of ai or such technology. old doesn't mean new just exposure at a particular time. Like how Brownlee says only a year later. We're always being lied to and there has always been footage of stuff."
A major hit on jobs.
Can‚Äôt wait for the CIA to disappear people but post AI-generated life streams of them to cover it up
And may be there will be a massive threat for content creation industry. üéâ
You‚Äôre not overreacting. This is crazy
This is the end of actors
"there will eventually come an era where video evidences dont mean jack sh*t anymore, this some crazy time we live in folks"
"This tool will be a fad in the long run. The thing about art is the appreciation of it actually lies in the craftmanship and inspiration of the artist. If everyone can do it, it loses value. 

My point is, people will become bored really quick, because of this technology. Content is readily available nowadays, and you can basically watch it anywhere. Now even though thats convenient, it doesn't compare to the 90s where you had to go out and buy physical media and had certain limitations to what you could watch. The appreciation of scarcity plays a large role in how we consume and experience media and art. 

Just imagine how awesome the experience would be of being able to attend an actual symphony, when living in the 19th century, an era where music was barely heard on a day to day basis by most people. 

If everyones an ""artist"" no one is an artist. People lose their interest in the sea of availability and mediocrity. We would get an enormous dip in quality, before actually realising this is not what actually satisfies our deepest urges and potentialities. Eventually this AI technology will become trivial overtime and will only be used for certain practical areas, most likely to cut costs, like commercials or powepoint presentations. 

AI will never replace real art and real artists; real craftsmanship and real people."
good! get rid of Hollywood!
"The first clip, the lady thumb is scary long"
I think AI content should be tagged and people SHOULD be able to filther ai content out of their searches.
Yeah same with Midjourney... Music is next...
Here comes the sun
I hate AI.
And this is only what is public... What is happening in the research labs would probably be terrifying...
"Actually this has the potential to come out with more creative content, since it can be prompted by people making requests without any constraints about locations, props etc. The content will be based on how well people can make the right directions or ask the right questions.

Yes, it's scary though for what it can do for disinformation, and in the age of ""free speech absolutists"" providing platforms with zero censorship and near zero fact checking is especially troubling."
"I don't know how to feel about all this AI revolution, but I'm not happy, not even curious, I think I'm scared, not only for the obvious stuff, like the jobs that will be replaced or changed (if it is what you're thinking), but for humanity as a whole. We're getting to a point that will be impossible distinguish reality from illusion, even for cyber-security experts."
"If it can edit people out of videos, then I‚Äôm all in lol. Otherwise, it‚Äôll just be another way to enshittify our digital entertainment experience, due to racing towards lower costs to make art that people care about.

One thing that I‚Äôm hopeful for is the realization from folks who would make these kinds of administrative/management/direction decisions is where the buck stops when public review goes south.

Being much more visible due to downsizing and subcontracting less will have risks.

Beyond that: people are gonna end up towards more human-made art, due to oversaturation of this kind of art once it gets more widely accessible."
This is so immensely disturbing.  No one will be able to tell what is real.  So many creative people will lose work.  We've gone too far.
Scary stuff.
This is terrifying for the future of humanity...but it's awesome for stock video footage. Lol.
"On my channel I do filtered lip syncing etc. I‚Äôve sent my videos to older friends and neighbors who are very intelligent discerning people. They got fooled into thinking filtered videos were real (holding a fake dog, sloth) and they‚Äôre _nothing_ like the AI clips in this video. It‚Äôs pretty scary."
"While the IP lawyers duke it out in courts, I'm just salivating at the prospect of all the fan made movies of obscure IPs that Hollywood wouldn't touch. Imagine the likes of Fallout TV, Warhammer 40k - Astartes and Battletech - Hired Steel but produced in weeks by dedicated fans instead of years by rare individuals with technical skills."
People by the tens of thousands are losing their jobs because of AI. Nothing good will come from AI.
Drone operators and photographers are still very needed to make DATASETS to train neural networks on. The difference is they would be paid by openai not the stock clips users.
AI is getting scary good. Hopefuly we don't get scammed by AI material.
AI makes me so itchy idk why :(
Plot twist: this video is generated by ai
"Its scary cuz its like we had a grasp on art, videography, or whatever ai is doing at the time, and its just slipping away and we can't rely on that for income anymore, we have to figure something else out, just to know that that might later get replaced by ai. I hate it"
"5:15
Hahahannahhh  !!!!
Coincidence the ""AI"" as given the 33 number on the forehead of the space guy !!!
It's soooooooo oblivioussssss !
ü§°üí©üëπüë∫"
There‚Äôs a war on creatives.
Imagine a biology teacher empowered with this. Generating very specific videos of cells and shit for their classes. Awesome.
"I was so hoping that there would be a big rig pull at the end of the video, where you revealed that this whole video was generated by AI."
And I‚Äôm supposed to believe we‚Äôre not living in a simulation. Ha! Yeah okkkay
"Most people don't seem to know the difference between art, design, 'artful' pictures or eye candy. I think for some people, a true artwork that comes form a conscious being will hold a new special significance they never noticed, but for others, they simply won't care unless its useful to them."
"@Marques Brownlee

Did you just watch the Two Minute Papers release then download it and cut out some of its footage and comment on it? That's a bit of a rip, isn't it?"
the dream is to feed the next generation into AI and get more seasons
All fun and games until the detectives are bringing you downtown talking about they have received some footage of you on camera doing some stuff you have no clue about. Shits going to get wicked fast....
"Nowadays, I only believe what I see in person. The rest I view with scepticism."
"Unfortunately regular people don't know that it isn't 1 year that researchers try to generate videos, but at least 10. Yes, 10. 10 years ago I was working on video analysis and following research there was already models generating videos. They weren't this good, but it took decades to get here, and maybe most importantly with these things getting 90% there is orders of magnitude easier than getting the last 10% right. What does this mean? That this, without fundamentally changing models, might very well be the peak or very close to the peak of what's achievable."
Don¬¥t use technology which is directed against the people
"Hollywood industry will be competing against machines in no time, might be a good idea as so many films re crap anyway!"
"Imagine the first feature film totally by AI....

Made up actors.. no cinematographers... no make up artists....production crews...like really.....Im not sure i like all thats to come hahah...no doubt the first film will make millions, billions....not for how good the story is...but just out of curiosity people will go..."

"Except you can easily get AI porn images now, because people got their own copies of the generative software, and trained it with faces and  nude images, etc., so, once the software gets to the point where people have their own copies, there is nothing to prevent someone from generating things with real likenesses. There needs to be things hidden in the software which puts a digitally irremovable watermark on every single video -- eventually, some Bright Boy is going to remove that, but if you design the interlocking stuff well enough, it should at least give us a bit more time.

I would be a hell of a lot more concerned with possible political implications of this coming into the next six months. If the public is not expecting fake vids as conceivably possible, releasing a 10-15 second ""october surprise!"" video may be a lot more important. Either way, the political implications in the next 4y is serious. The public needs to be ""inoculated"" against these possible fakes, so they are substantially wary of them."
"Great topic, loved the presentation and as you noted, both very cool and very scary.  It won't be too long before tools like this won't be managed by organizations that, in theory, don't want it to be abused and do their best to prevent that.  From a political and social standpoint, this has very scary ramifications."
Why is it human nature to create things that will eventually lead to our demise?
"*whispers* :....""AI-generated Fanfiction era is gonna be epic"""
"A time when computers do the creating and humans do the labor is not the future we wanted!

Spread this message"
"More and more I feel like we are some kind of AI. Memory stored, or something similar. Nick Bostrom is right in my mind at least."
The strength of this tool will be to prepare eg animated frames and let engines like this to fill in the gaps. It will save a lot of rendering and frames etc and prototyping.
"Every time I think ""well, it's standing on the shoulders of human creativity to manufacture a facsimile"" .... I then hear the prompt that led to that image or video, and think of all the decisions it made to realize the scene that meets the description.  I know it isn't actual creativity, but at a certain point ... what's the difference?"
Damn this is scaaary fr
"I think you're overselling how ""cheap"" and accessible this is going to be. The price of content generation by AI is massively underpriced right now because the OpenAIs are trying to get people used to (""hooked"") on using AI for everything in their lives and not think about the costs. These models take a massive amount of energy to train and an even larger amount of energy to run on a regular basis. Those costs are being hidden right now but they're not going away just because the technology is getting better and more impressive. I'm not NOT worried about the labor implications to wide swaths of the production economy being replaced by AI, but I also think if those AI drone shots were priced correctly, they wouldn't be used willynilly in a corporate presentation as stock footage."
The Bible says that in the last days knowledge would increase. The technology for the Beast system is being implemented.
this is making me think that maybe the threat of AI stealing creative jobs is an actual concern
Its that good I refuse to believe it. I wouldn't be surprised if they were lying. But why would they?
"It's something I can see the movie and advertising industry investing heavily into, üòû Does that mean that the cost of movies tickets would come down? I doubt it."
"8:50 - yeh you do have to say why it's weird. what's weird about it other than him facing in the other direction? the belt is going in the right direction, no? any person could fk around like that on a treadmill like people running up a down escalator."
"The Crazy part is ai dot com is redirected to this video of MKBHD, suggests he bought it... something's coming soon in the field of AI from MKBHD"
Generic Concerned Comment
Wow! Like weird stuff!
"Listen, this is only going to be used for ""free"" stock footage and that is that. It might be possible that those people who don't have the 'right' appearance or voices to do reviews currently will do them this way - it's another plus for the introverts and the outcasts, I guess. Absolutely nobody else will be interested in interacting with AI otherwise, apart from the pervy guys who will 'make their own' virtual sex workers."
"genmo AI is already well created, sora is great"
‚ù§
We are truly in the matrix
"Honestly all the videos you showed are high levels of uncannieness. But like you said, this is the worse the technology is going to be. In 10 years, it very well could be almost indistinguishable."
"This is very impressive but will probably cost thousands $ per month for users. If ChatGPT takes a few hundreds mb up to 1gb of text data to go through for every user text inquire which is fairly expensive for OpenAI, how many GB or Terabytes would it need to go through for videos on each user's inquire? Joining text is also thousands of times less compute intensive than joining pixels of a video. But even if this service was $5k per month it's still a lot cheaper for many content creators than hiring someone."
"Thanx, you are brilliant!"
"Nice channel / video. Wild stuff man,"
Humans are securing their own obsolescence.
Now all they gotta do is add sound.
Someone at Dreamworks said that they predict 90% of resources used to create their films in the future will be entirely AI.
Is anyone else sad that we won‚Äôt be getting more Will Smith eating spaghetti?
"All dystopian ans revolutionary BS aside, what is the point of content if it can be generated so easily by any idiot with a chat-gpt subscription. Am I the only one asking themselves a question like that? 

Why would I let an ad catch my attention if every ad is better or just as good? Why would I watch a movie if all shots are crazy and mindblowing yet easily generated like all thr shots after them?"
AI movies are gonna go crazy
"Dude, we are all so F***ed!  And there's no stopping it. Wait until you're pulled over by RoboCop and you reach for your wallet too fast."
he probably is THE selected creator testing it
I think making movies in the future will be very cheap that everybody will make his own movie
"not for public. Before that, meh."
"Progress and evolution have to be regressive behaviour. We're headed into the past. Because this makes me think that eventually what we get is our own perception. The future version of this technology already took over everything imo, including you."
bro i was shook just now at a ai video i made just now
Wolf pup spawner activated.
"We need heavy regulation to keep this technology in check. Unfortunately, much of Congress doesn't understand how the internet works or how to restart a computer."
fake news just got really scary.
Will Smith eating Spaghetti is still my favorite ü§£
I am so so so without a job
just cleared the uncanny valley
I already saw Will Smith eating spaghetti with the new tech and it looked so freakin real
"It's not the worst this technology is going to be from here out... As AI media continues to pervade the world and it teaches other AI its mistakes it breaks down. Look up ""model colapse"" to see the full info, but basically it's a copy of a copy of a copy is always going to show artifacts. AI does it so rapidly that it eventually _only_ outputs artifacts."
Hollywood is out of business soon.
Maybe this video is AI generated 
Joan is awful gonna hit Netflix next year ifykyk

The stylish woman in Tokyo's LEGS hurt my brain
This shit has the ability to start WW3. I'm worried.
So where is the new version of Will Smith eating spaghetti?
scaryy
The world of technology is becoming very scary. What job will I have
"Thank you for sharing. I appreciate the commentary and opinion on how this technology will work. Being someone who is researching applications of A.I., this was very helpful."
I‚Äôm not long for this world
What I find lacking in these AI people is the soulless eyes. And then there is Worldcoin. Scary?
Exiting and Scary üòÖ
WHOA! So the question is do we protest against it or start cloning ourselves?
Thats where video games are heading. Cant wait fifa to look like that
"will it really be for a ""small subscription"" price? Will it really?"
WE ARE COOKED!
This will kill so many jobs
lol  the Ai looks better than real life
I would love to see screenplays put into this to see how it matches up with the original movie.  Like Pulp Fiction
it looks like a video game still
Bye bye Hollywood
Am I the only one who is creeped out by these people not existing?!?!
the puppies appearing out of thin air is disturbing
makes one wonder if we really are in a simulation
Sam altman be lying in joe rogan podcast few month ago.
Imagine download an ebook and they shoot a movie... would be a 10hrs + but its a thing to take into consideration
Ngl this is actually crazy. Developers are opening Pandora's box with this
Now combine this with virtual reality and you can see where this is all going.
Never gonna have to pay actors ever again
"To truly know how much ai has improved, I would have to see it make Will Smith eating spaghetti again."
"Isn't it wild we still live under capitalism even though it requires poverty and prevents progress but we still push through in spite and just empoversh more people, we could have all this stuff even faster and better and not put people in danger of losing livelyhoods. We're just too sunk cost on capitalism. Just like we threw out fudalism it's time to move forward and give us our freedom, *actual* democracy (also in the workplace) and universal basic services (food, housing, healthcare,education and transportation services, etc)

We could all have that today but nope, gotta keep poverty so billionares can joke about not even knowing what to do with all their money while more and more people are starving and homless each year with plenty of unused homes and wasted food..."

"‚ÄúSimpsons predictions until 2040 mean ASI won't be made by then. This means all predictions about AGI before then are wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have already found several ways to surpass the speed of light, like wormholes and warp drives. AGI hasn‚Äôt been spotted anywhere in our universe. It could be invisible (but why would it be invisible for millions of years?). If aliens haven‚Äôt made AGI yet, then we might be the first ones to do so. Either that, or we‚Äôre the only ones living (and that brings many theories, like the simulation theory or religious beliefs).‚Äù

‚ÄúChatGPT can stop cyberbullying and improve social skills with replies.‚Äù"
0:34 Gotta love seeing her legs swap.
"while the latest ai generated videos looks very realistic, they look uncanny at some points... for ex.: that red dress lady, look at the legs while it moves, there is something odd happening there."
"OpenAI already made GPT-4.5, and its said to be able to do any task a human can do, so that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt released it yet, and they are working on other stuff"
You can still tell if it's fake by looking at the eyes.
"People think this will be 10 to 15 years before it will effect jobs for everyday people, I think in 3 to 5 years will see this happen.  It's already happening in IT across the board.  We'll need to focus on how we fit into this picture."
Literally writing ourselves out of existence. We have to stop this. üíØ
This video is a captivating exploration into the transformative power of AI-generated videos. Thanks for bringing this up
I like spagetti more

No one has mentioned porn yet but everyone is thinking it.
"I saw the red motorcycle helmet astronauts before, but I NEVER knew it was AI! I honestly thought it was real until now"

"If you'd been playing video games for 20 years like I have, and have seen all the evolving, especially with the coming of the Unreal engine, you would nod in agreement. The question is how is the-average-mo, going to render out real-looking footage? How beefy their computers need to be, to do anything more than 10 frames per hour?"
Can you imagine? They can replace those snowflake actors and not pay them millions of dollars.
This is good
"Would you talk more about the wolves video, I feel the same wayüòÇIt's not as easy as it seems."
Bonkers. Thank you.
"Why are you so shocked? CGI guys have done these since decades ago.
Now some guys made all these automated by compiling all the videos available on internet combined with very sophisticated 3D engines (i.e. Unreal Engine 5).
They gave a name to this kind of app -> AI
AI is good, but not as good as an average CGI guy.
AI is fast....  just like any computer processing program... so."
"Crazy how realistic the coastal drone shot was, not sure if it means the drone era will be shorter than expected but who knows?? üòÆüòÆüòÆ"
There‚Äôs nothing like human creativity though.
"Why does my brain immediately go to all the bad things this could bring üò≥ I can‚Äôt definitely see some great uses, but man the battle of real vs AI will be epic!"
"Dude your takes are 100% in aligned with my own thoughts, very smart, I agree on the stock footage, right on.   I think the creativity may be the thing now though... like the TV stack of the old TV's, it isn't HOW you get the video, it is the content of the video itself that is interesting and useful. 

I think you need to push ""Will Smith eating spaghetti"" through the new one and compare them side by side. 

I couldn't tell the birthday cake one until you mentioned it.   People won't see it."
As videographer and creator I knew this was coming and still can't seem to get past hating this.
Creating ai to be this powerful is the same logic of creating Jurassic park and expecting nothing to go wrong. Human arrogance will be our downfall
The crazy part you or people you know can be anywhere or make planets up or bring extinct animals just for a moment in time
"Hollywood, as we know it, is doomed - who needs human crews at big $$$ when all you will need is a piece of software - watershed moment"
We need algorithms to detect what is real or AI generated. And we need them yesterday.
"This also has huge implications for the environment. People have been complaining about how much energy it uses to train and run these models, but once people actually start replacing doing things and driving or flying to locations and instead just enter a prompt, so much CO2 will be saved."
"Not popular opinion but I don't care: 
We are being manipulated at a very high level so that feeling displaced or threatened by technology is frowned upon by other humans. It's strange that those who express sadness are embraced, but those who admit to feeling vulnerable to AI face collective bullying, based solely on arguments like ""you have to get on that bus"" or ""the best will survive"" and similar nonsense.  Wake up, look around, because in 3 years, no one will be better than AI in any field."
looking at those hands in the grandma video made me have to physically look away from how weird it was lmao
"told a homie back in 2018 when I got drunk that AI will be the next thing to be forced on our day to day lives, and to keep in mind the year 2029 because everything might start crumbling at that point. I used to look back and feel stupid for saying that, but It's starting to make more sense every year"
"Is anyone else at a loss for words...

Also, I'm a sound designer. Is my career going bye bye? I know this isn't an sfx related video. I just know music and sound is on the list."
I am SUPER interested to see what happens to this tool when it inevitably cannibalizes itself by training on video it previously created.
"if the AI needs more real footage to use, just give it some lil drone cameras to go get whatever footage it wants. lol kinda scary to think about but im into it."
Will actors be necessary in a few more years?
We need to get this under control now. Before the robots take over Hollywood
"i‚Äôm sorry, 0:32 watch the lady‚Äôs legs skip and then rotate and switch sides as she walks‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so much worse than will smith watching spaghetti."

Thanks, Matt"
Kinda funny that both young artists and young AI have difficulty doing hands.

"Honestly this puts everything into perspective, the guy who claimed ai will become more intelligent than humans by ""2045"" wasn't stretching at all. And with how everyone  reacting is we are more than definitely not prepared."
This will be weaponized 100%
I don't know why I thought Marquees was an AI the entire video lol

"AI is interesting, but it is going to decimate so many industry jobs. Our populations are growing all around the world (other than Russia) and we will have less jobs as time goes on (this was already the case). Our future looks grim."
"crazy thing that not everyone notice but at  2:25 , her legs switch places and thats hella creepy üòÇ"
"We used to TRAIN AI models. In the future, humans will be TRAINED to catch AI."
"AI is just the next method for the 0.01% to fire more workers and spend less to make a worse product and ask the same (if not more) money for it.

This shit is terrible for normal people and terrible for the economy."
Actors won't be needed soon. As well as many other professions and not only in the film industry.
"This is fascinating, because it is a window into how we process images in our own brains. When we first look at something, we go through a series of increasingly accurate models of the thing we are seeing. The first split second could be all sorts of crazy things, but which are rapidly over-written as you continue to observe the thing. I'm certain that those who suffer from schizophrenia have faulty visual and/or audio processing."
Scary part is someone assinating a president and that country still keeping the president alive by using this tech. Or a country infiltrating another using this.
Is Sora using CGI?
"Regardless, those videos still look like they came out of an episode of the Twilight Zone. But of course, this is not the military-grade classified stuff."
"What really saddens me about this is that ai is killing talent. Once ai  robotics goes public ""no one"" will ever be special again. From arts to sports to entertainment to science Im glad to have witnessed the last greatness of humanity in my life purely from blood and sweat and tears and hours put in their passion al."

that was something horrifying as it was crazy good but as you said with all the ai doing magic with just a text prompt it is really scary of how it can be used in dangeorous ways

someone clearly needs to prompt will smith eating spaghetti so we can do a proper side by side
Nothing good could ever come from Ai generated videos
This is what happens when you let nerds go unbullied.
I thihk the strangest part about AI is that its replacing most of the art related jobs. I allways thought about AI being more like technological jobs that are at risk or low income job. But i fear that those jobs will stay and all the nice art jobs will be replaced.

"The scariest part is extrapolating this out to 3D immersive worlds to be used in future generations of virtual reality tech.  

Imagine (with enough compute power) being able to ask the AI to put you into your own personally prompted world, that would eventually be tied into something like neural link, constantly creating a new reality on the fly, indistinguishable  from real life.

"Weird thought this but with the destruction of natural environments it feels like this will enable corporations and governments to keep over exploiting the planet while we, the people, can gladly fool ourselves into thinking everything is fine because we can create and visually enjoy beautiful perfect landscapes out of nothing... a sort of total disconnect between our on screen experience we are being pushed and pushed further into and a global reality."
"This is how the TikTok generation will be controlled.  Noone will know whats real or not. The only upside to this is that in person work e.g. plumbing will be cheaper because more people will have to do it. Human itelligence created content will be a premium, much like the theatre is today."

"As far as I am concerned AI generated videos are pirated videos. 

Through sophisticated software interpolation these software companies are taking other people's work and through the veil of algorithms are remixing them into what they are calling new ai generated videos. It should technically be illegal. 

Suffix to say, if traditional video makers stop bringing out high quality video content, we will start to see the quality of AI generated videos go down. AI needs source material to work. No source material = no AI."
why are video game cinematics so poor
"New tech stuff has usually already been available for a number of years, before they get introduced to the public consumer market. That makes you think doesn't it?"

"@mkbhd So I guess we need to look at a more sustainable way to live and work as we seem to be getting into that ""we need star trek economy"" kinda place. Otherwise the gaps will become bigger, the wars will come more often, etc. Lets make it good for everyone. Between passive houses, zero waste tech and Permaculture Forests we may just make it a cool future for everyone, not just humans!"
They clapping on the 1s and 3s
2:28 the right foot BECOMES the left foot. Walking looks to be ai videos equivalent of ai arts ability to draw hands.
We cannot trust our eyes solely anymore.
"Humankind was not ready for social media and the effects it brought with it.. and we're STILL trying to figure that part out. Just imagine what AI will do in the future.. and we're not even talking about the distant future. AI is here to stay.. but I'm not too sure about us, though.."
"I guess it's not a bad thing I'm starting my own youtube channels and starting other businesses. I work in film, game, and animation industries. I'm still starting as a junior level and I graduated with my bachelor's in 2018. Ay-Eye is disappointing and it's going to take control of everything."
2:26 LOL... watch her legs cross over ü§£ - but really astonishingly good!
"Yeah, this stuff should be restricted to not generate videos with real people, especially public officials; generated videos should have watermarks, yada yada... BUT!:
1) Implementing that in a way that can't be circumvented is incredibly difficult.
2) In a few months Meta is going to have this and (in Yann LeCun's infinite wisdom) open-source their model; then everybody and their grandma will be able to do whatever the ***k they want.
3) Two months later Elon Musk is going to have this and will tune the model to generate *only* embarrassing videos of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren; he's going to call it ""maximum truth-seeking free-speech video generation model""."
The matrix is becoming more and more a reality. A computer is generating images that you can't distinguish from reality. I don't understand how the computer does this. It's not like its making 3d models like in games right?
Im really concerned for all women and children in this world. This technology will 100% be used to generate child and revenge porn
we are 10 years closer to Blade runner 2049 in reality
why did I all of a sudden get MKBHD Update 5.0 recommended to me even though I don't watch your channel?
what is real?
The world is about to get even crazier than it already is
This technology is dangerous and needs to be regulated. Videos generated by this should be watermarked in some way.
"WOW, I've never seen forever?"
"That spaghetti video , ugh!"
you didnt do a remake of will smith eating spaghetti
This will come in so handy for people that like to fix their own cars. Imagine being able to just get a detailed video tutorial on how to change the back brake pads and discs of say a Peugeot 2008. It comes with a built in wheel bearing and it's a bitch to find a good detailed video tutorial online for it. Can't wait for this to go public should be good
The example at 0:35 isn't a good one - looks like her legs cross and exchange with each other.
"Make a video of ""Will Smith Eating Spaghetti"", that will let us know how far it's REALLY gone!"
"Plot twist, This video was AI generated and that was not the real Marcus"
Tell me it didn't use Tom Hardy and Chase from House in that spaceman trailer.
"FYI, Will Smith eating spaghetti in Sora has just been uploaded by him on Insta. And it looks terrifyingly good..."
Gonna be so easy for the FBI to frame people now
"At around 2.27 mark her legs swap over, as you say not perfect."
i understand now how the people of end times would be decived by the anti christ.
The future is indeed existing
Thats scary and amazing at the same time üòÖ
"In 2013 India - a member of the political party BJP had uploaded a video (actually from Pakistan) on facebook showing a mob lynching 2 men - - (falsely) claiming that a Muslim killed 2 Hindu men in his area. 

As a result - hundred of incidences of mob violence targetting Muslims were reported - - 150 people were killed, hundreds raped by the Hindu mobs (organised by BJP and) incited by the Video. 
in addition 50000 people were displaced as they could not go to their villages where they were attacked - All the victims belonged Muslim minority. 

If a fake video can cause so much damage - - - the AI generated content can wreck havoc. This Generative AI Tech has made the job of Far Right  politicians/mobsters just too easy.

Generative AI needs to be stopped before it start creating real world problems"
ALL my CG artist friends are panicking.... where should they go in the future?... Especially those who are still working in the film industry...
Worth noting that the spaghetti video was made by a guy using open source stuff on their pc and not from OpenAI with their insane hardware and research. I mean it is still extremely impressive but one year ago OpenAI probably wasn't that far from it.
"Great summation. We are VERY close to a full 90 minute AI-generated feature film. Cloud guy does have weirdly elongated fingers btw. Salt astronaut is astonishing. Birthday lady has terrifying expressions. 
And this is devastating to stock footage shops and ANYONE who works on a camera crew of any kind."
Amazing! Is there any data on the current rendering times? I'm curious: how long does SORA need to generate a 1 minute video?

"it looks terrible, the hands are always like aliens"
"I just want to say: this technology is going to have the same impact that Photoshop had for the world of still images. If you remember, when Photoshop became popular, we could no longer be sure what images were or were not real. In the ensuing years, we never found a solution to that problem. There was no way to analyze a picture to determine if it had been Photoshopped, nor was there any way to check the provenance of a photo to determine if it was real. We never grew more savvy about the images we were presented, but instead remained forever trusting, or forever distrusting, or forever unsure. And as a result, society collapsed, and everyone died. Now, thanks to AI-generated video, society is going to collapse and everyone is going to die, again."
The host is high quality‚Äîa real pro.
Actors in Hollywood and not just them but all actors must be concerned 
Welcome to a commercial  age. Any could be on TV.
"All the comments on here could soon be just a bunch of AI generated ones to get $$ for the person who posted AI content. 
It will kill YouTube and social media."
"My outlook on this. Its inevitable, it has always been inevitable. There is nothing you can do to stop it. Automation, robotics, and Ai generated and driven content is the future. Jobs will disappear and people won't be working for a living the way we currently do."
Imagine telling future sora ai use unreal 5 and video game demo of the matrix to translate all of matrix online into a working game.
Now I am having doubt is this video ai generated?
Imagine when they add aI upscaling to vr/ar
"There is no longer a way for anybody to trust any video proof of crimes as being legitimate in court. 
No longer can the news be trusted to be showing the truth in wars or politics.
No longer can a person of any age or gender feel safe that they will not be recognized soon in a porno.
There is no way to ensure anything on the internet, including typed books, old looking newspapers, and AI telling us they translated burnt thousands of years old scrolls‚Ä¶.that it is not a pure 100% lie. 

READ BOOKS, books you can find that are old, save them all. 
Do NOT throw out old newspapers! 
Bring back film cameras, and print photos in a lab darkroom.

Your kids will have nothing to trust is real."
11:25 There's only one way to find out
bro i did not remember will smith eating spaghetti and now im dead
lol so is the future going to be more fake from now on? ew
Imagine trying to hide porn from your kids w/ all these safeguards and they can just make it up.
"I'm concerned that a lot of studios especially in the advertising industry are going to stop hiring artists and animation /sfx groups to do their ads and instead be looking for people to touch up AI footage for them, for a quarter of the pay or less."
"there is a really easy solution we HAVE to implement now...
the problem is... I know how to solve it but how do I get it off the ground, I kinda dont want any giant gov to make it happen as i wont trust it..
I think I might setup a website and start a campaign."
"Theyr're trying to make us forget about the past, (rewrite history). You will never know what's real from the past anymore!"
"Not an over reaction....
Not only is the shit this enables ridiculous
the people creating these AI tools have full access while telling everyone else what is ""ok"" to talk about or have drawn."
2025 we will have AI video reviewing this video.. A.I.-ception
to assustada marques. faz isso parar
I wonder how long will it take for AI to make a theory of everything
"This is beyond the pale, remember when the pictures looked like a fever dream of eyes? What on earth will this look like in 2030???
You could generate a movie that you can't even remember."

"That first video of the woman walking is hilarious if you watch her feet. They are wobbling in amd out, sometimes she forgets how to walk, and once her right and left leg swap places"
Love that the girl's legs at 0:33 were basically twirling like a merry-go-round. LOL.
"I was going to study film, I switched to animation


am I just screwed in any of these fields there will be no jobs after I'm done with school"
"*4 months later: ""what is reality?""*"
New age memes gonna go hard and so are the blackmails
"Thanks for the update on the state of AI video. 
It's insane to see how real these videos feel, and I can't help but be worried about the ways it will be used for deception..."
the disinformation campains and propaganda videos never going to be easier to make I think thats the main threat from this all
Nobody I've tried to talk to about AI and what's currently going on can even contemplate the implications of this. It blows my mind ü§Ø
I am definitely excited for the stock possibilities. I am already using SDXL for images... why not use AI for video too.
"Plot twist, thats not real MKBHD sharing his take on Sora"
These clips are deeply unsettling on a visceral level.
Return to analog
RIP the artist ( myself included )
this is a completely sora generated mkbhd FYI.
"Reality is getting less and less appreciated and LIVED, and fantasy is getting more and more ‚Äúreal‚Äù.
We are detaching from reality and ourselves at a scary pace!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôà
We are deceiving ourselves making ourselves obsolete at very fast pace!"
Gleaning from other peoples photo and video should be regulated.  If AI references something you have made you get compensation for the creation of whatever video is created.  Even if its pennies.  I think there needs to be some kind of guardrails.
The whole time I was suspecting this video was AI-generated. ChatGBT? MKBHD!
The legs of the woman in the dress rotate around to the wrong side. Very weird
"This new level of gen is still Theft. AI is theft, and if we dont stop it for that simple reason, there will be no stopping it and no content creators. Content is a global economy and AI is here to obliterate it."
ok now I finally get Wall-E
I honestly think there should be laws put in place now to stop the advancement of AI generated images and video. There‚Äôs no real need for it. It will cause way more harm than good.
R.I.P Humans
"Influencers are gonna be without a job, soon actors, porn actresses, web cam models... Youtube creators. I mean someone using AI can create content 10 times faster and cheaper than someone without"
"It looks like it has a sense of humor. The birthday candle flames going different directions, seemed kind of whimsical, maybe on purpose."
"Me watching a video of me commiting a crime while I'm at my home üíÄ. Im not the type of person who says AI will end humans aaah, but damn this is scary"
Couldn‚Äôt chat GPT use SORA to create a whole film since most scenes are like seconds long each transitions
My eyes automatically stared noticing your hand movements üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ
Information is no longer information.
Imagine real time Ai video generation in a vitual reality world with prompt creation based on events
Blackmailing just got bigger.
It's like watching a baby's struggle to understand the enviroment. With the amounts of data available It will get more realistic.
Quiting the internet entirely as a solution to not be fooled is not going to work when everyone you talk with IRL are telling you stuff they heard about online or on TV.
Me feeling more and more like David After Dentist all of the time.
we are cooked
"Let's wait ten years and see how tech like Apple vision and AI generated video mix together, gonna be fun. Or not?"
"Sir, women can fool me with make-up..."
"At the end he should've said ""oh and by the way, this whole video is AI generated!"""
Love yall
It's funny how you all think this video itself is real.
New moon landing is going to be easy peasy.
Imagine just how good games with this type of generated video will look.
all so scary
would be nice if you showed the will smith video using sora to have an apples to apples comparison
"Here‚Äôs the biggest issue       Now videos of crimes and murders are going to be no longer just proof of anything   (Or just videos of real life occurrences in general) That strikes me as a gigantic problem        Or even if the police investigate you and they find that your vehicle was seen at a street corner near a crime scene      And it goes to trial      All you need is a convincing ‚Äúexpert‚Äù to show other videos side by side of it that he created just using his words on a site and it could easily provide reasonable doubt      

Yeah I think any sort of positives that could come from this are really limited         ‚ÄúStock footage improvements‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do anything for 99.9% of people      lol and that‚Äôs the huge positive ? 

We need to stop this now somehow           All of these videos would pass as legit to everyone who didn‚Äôt know they were viewing a fake video     Everyone         No one can tell that the frame rate is off in the water reflections    

It‚Äôs going to cost a LOT of jobs     And make super rich people even richer      Tech people         This is bad news man        I‚Äôd be looking for a new job and a new career now if I worked for a big company doing video work of any kind      It‚Äôs not even a question anymore of like ‚Äúthis guy has been with us for 8 years, ever since we were a startup    I dunno it feels wrong‚Äù       They just lay you off without consideration if it makes the company more money 

Every company with more than 200 employees or so would do that without hesitation if they could        All of these jobs that technology created are slowly being taken back by technology      No one seems too worried about it either            ‚ÄúWow this is cool‚Äù is not enough of a reason for something this world changing"
You got me analyzing this video of you and trying to see if there is any AI in it
"The scariest part of this tech is the day when ""THE PRESIDENT"" is on TV talking to the country and it is AI generated. Definitely going to have licenses for the internet in the future to help identify users."
"wow, I see this as possibly changing the way we produce and watch movies.  Can you imagine a world where everyone makes their own short movie in 1 day, zero budget and sharing their movies on a movie social media platform."
Were gonna reach a point where we can feed the Ai images of our characters and it will generate animations of those characters. Soon we might get people making entire anime with Ai. We already saw that rock paper scissors thing that was pulled off. It will only get better and better

"We‚Äôre not that far away brother. China is already making movies using AI, and they look very real. Many actors will be out of business. Only the really good ones will be around.  America will lag behind because of the age of the leaders, but it‚Äôs coming soon because they can‚Äôt stop it. BTW. I thought we were competing with China on tech."
"It all depends on whether people would like to replace a photo, which captures a moment frozen in time, with a digitally illustrated image that is less meaningful and less organic than photo or video"
"I was waiting for him to say ""and this isn't me, this whole video was ai generated"" üòÖ"
"I find it hard to believe that the AI generated video content isn't ""referencing"" actual video footage, and eventually people will spot elements of their videos, and cry foul. If it is actually 100% original video material, then that is beyond frightening!"
Yo that guy gliding is so creepy omg
"Amazing as always. Great work! 
Long live AI :) Looking forward to all the time soon that I can spend on be creative instead of chasing video shots."
"at some point bots and robots aka ""avatars"" will be walking around us in real life also looking like real humans..."
I don't like how some people get access and therefore stay ahead on the internet...
AI will continue to grow üòäüòä
Where does it get it's visuals from?
This video made me go back and watch a bit of your very first YouTube video review (of a media remote) just for the nostalgia/perspective of seeing how far the world and technology has come since then. I can‚Äôt even imagine what watching this video fifteen years from now will feel like and where technology will be. ü§Ø
"The terrifying part is what ot can be uses for.
And it can be used for abusive means such as politics, and further complications."
It does look a little off but there are also mobile phone video effects now and one could assume it was a filter?
"This is how our version of the human experiment will end. Someone will make videos showing world leaders being hurt badly, allies will gut react, nukes, boom, bye world, bye.

No I'm fine. And yeah of course people are going to create videos of Biden falling eternally, like a Dark Souls roll that never ends, or Trump being an annoying slob who knows how to get people to react in the way . . . oh . . .

But worse? Police creating videos to falsely accuse and mass imprison ""undesirables"". It's horrifying because all it would take is knowing when and were someone is, knowing when they're asleep so they have no alibi, and just timestamping the crime for that time.  And yeah I don't think it would be ok that there would be police brutality videos that are fake too.
 
Corporations will put out videos excusing dehumanizing and barcoding all of us to have modern slaves < I was a modern slave but in a different way for different people and different reasons, it's horrible and always a huge fear and a massive concern since it happens all the time on a very large but also small scale relative to direct corporate slavery >.

What else? New species prompting donations for wildlife conservation for animals that don't exist. Other donation scams surely?
Products that don't exist. 

Fully realized VRMMO world that procedurally generate and look, sound, feel, smell, just everything is perfect . . . ok that's not a bad thing . . .
It wouldn't be necessarily bad to have currently existing games adapted to a VR format either. 

Like there's some positives here but the laws need to be put in place FAST to prevent absolute chaos. The tech is here. There is no going back without wiping all tech which would put the human race a lot further back than people think. People see survival shows and games and think, ""Oh I can do that!"". No. You can't. Very few people are prepared.

We need protections. We need safeguards. We need laws that make sense and aren't just prohibiting use except by the 1% to mold the world they want. And that's likely exactly what will happen. And no one will support such a biased law so everyone will find work arounds and . . . chaos. It just doesn't end without chaos unless we have protections. Real and fair and functioning."
Did anyone else see the white horse on the left with half a body or just me ?
"What's crazy about this is we are going to witness the rise of a dystopian world where nobody will be able to tell what is real anymore on the internet. Anyone who thinks this isn't going to have immediate and very serious ramifications is dreaming. This is going to catapult us straight into a nightmare, probably within the next 10 years."
"I want to see it define cosmic horror and abstract concepts like Oroboros or mythological events and stories. And ""your mom"" porn. LMAO"

"This is actually scary just imagine the propaganda that can come from this, creepy. lol"
"Civilizations are documented notably by two things; art and war.  We rely on ART to provide the humanity and context of history. How can you see the masterpieces of marble, the frescos, architecture, writings, and music of the past without also wondering about the creativity, patience, and skills of the artist? Does the mastery of plaster and mosaic still exist or has it been lost to ""efficiency"" and labor costs?  As amazed as I am by the achievement of the brilliant minds who developed these tools, I am saddened by the hyper-accelerated demise of human artists.  If tomorrow's craftsmen can't earn a sustainable living, their passion and skills will soon be a novelty that the grandchildren will stare at in wonderment. When human toil is gone, so is the soul of the art.  With AI visualization, we also must teach our children and elders to distrust by default.  That is heartbreaking."
I really want to try this!
"Ik! It's way too crazy.
I wonder if we could all fight against it and not actually do anything. Like we all don't use I? It'd take alot of effort to get everyone together."
"its ok. i also do videos, social ecologic videos. this would be a great tool to help creativity. the problem here is this: techno-feudalism. as something post capitalism. much worst. the implications of this AI been used to control our culture and toughts. a great tool in a future communist world thou ..  .-)"
"Gunna get bare hate for this one but my biggest concern is them f@ckin with the aliens, it's gunna discredit the scene massively! And at a time where it's such a debated topic on a serious level for once, seems like we'll never get the truth"
I really want to see Sora's take on the Will Smith video so we have another benchmark for a year from now!
Don't understand... half of these look like video games and you're pretending they're photorealistic.
"Sora, please generate a video of Joe Biden being able to to put two sentences together. üòä"
You know what's better than A.I. generated videos? A.I. generated videoGAMES! >:D
"Those things are flooding Facebook with politician ""marketing"" with people making fake statements...."
"As a videographer I gotta say I'm threatened by this. I'm sure a lot of product videographers will lose their jobs unless they put a price wall on this technology eventually, like how it's a costs a lot more to render CG models than hiring a videographer, which I don't think will be the case. my bet is on event videography since people won't stop hosting events anytime soon. weddings, corporate dinners etc."
"This explains Joe Biden's press conferences, buggy AI."
Imo the ai hasn‚Äôt topped the will smith videos. Every human who‚Äôs seen the internet has seen that video

"It makes me happy to see what the future turns into, and I won't be alive. I spent my life hanging out with the right people, with the right emotions, ups, downs, creating music, photography, and that feeling when you make something your own. Even in my wildest dreams, I wouldn't like to experience having virtual modified friends and a robot girlfriend, and having AI create pictures and scenes for me that I want to see, because when you have everything in the digital palm of your hand, then you can't even experience real happiness."
So if it‚Äôs improved this much in 1 year it‚Äôs pretty safe to say we‚Äôll get full blown movies in AI?
ü§£ Thanks for posting!
yo the guy running on a treadmill made me laugh so hard
"Still the same issues like all of AI right now - it's only good as long as you ask it for shit that it was fed with. These models are and will continue to be highly biased, especially for minorities. The easiest test is to let the AI try to generate a black, transgender person for, say, a hundret times, and then ask yourself, why it did that.."
"It scrapes content other people have made. When it is no longer profitable for people to create, the AI will scrape itself, creating really bizarre horrors. It'll just become another version of homemade food -> fast & cheap food becoming popular -> homemade food becoming popular again because fast food doesn't taste the same, etc. All it does is kill the versatility of jobs while providing you with microwaved cartilage patty for the low price of a monthly subscription."
scary...
"I can easily see good uses for AIs like this, not only for stock content, but also for some fill-in scenes, like we can use digital art to help out in drawings (i.e. if you have trouble drawing something, you can ""generate"" it with AI, either for direct use or just for reference). But I can also easily see bad uses, like crimes, fake news and etc.

For the content creation industry, for one, I fear for the saturation of low level content due to mass production of AI-generated content for quick cash grab (like we already have some low effort channels or 'influencers' out there, with some already using AI to post content every 3h or so for engagement) while high level ones have to fight their life for a small piece of attention. Enter the indie section of any digital game shop and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

(Ironically, I got an ad at the end about ""being smart"" by using AI to ""work for you and becoming a millionaire"" while typing this comment)"
"Great, can't wait to have that one guy who sends you a full length movie he generated and asks you if you watched it yet every time you see him."
BUT SHOW ME WILL SMITH SPAGHETTI!!
"That first video with the lady walking in the red dress, I clocked her leg movement right away"
it's so joever
The irony that we're using AI to automate the production of art instead of the jobs we hate shouldn't be lost on us.
"I think the internet is shooting it's own foot. It will push people to see things with their own eyes. Live events, live video, live everything. Live beach? go to the beach. Live musician, go to the concert. Live politician, go to their parade. If it's not live it's not real. Or it's just wishful thinking and this is the Matrix, where's Neo?"

"Great, early retirement for everyone! :)
The sooner the AI and robots take over all of the jobs - the better.

We all need a few Optimus robots per person and it will be the end of human labor forever.
Unless you want to work and create something of course. :)

The transition period - the next 15 years - that might be tough though.
Hope we will find a solution as fast as possible.

"I wonder if it will start getting worse and worse if it begins to reference 'AI' generated, not quite right footage. 

All of the issues would start compounding."
"This is absolutely NUTZ!!!!!!!!!  IMO AI has no place here on earth, does anyone remember the Movie War Games where a computer almost started another world war!!!!!!! Great Video."
still not showing
"33 on the motorcycle helmet, time for conspiracy. The up shot is this kind of technology can be used to restore some of the oldest footage collecting dust in archives around the world. The downside is that whatever is public is much less powerful than what they have in house which surely some governments are customers of... Now imagine what an intelligence agency could do with it."
This car looks fantastic.  Once the update is released which sounds like it will be in the next two weeks I hope he reviews it again.  I can‚Äôt wait until there‚Äôs a dealership close enough to test drive one myself
"Maybe it would be more impressive if we were able to see the knowledge sources that the AI is referencing? Then we could determine how truly creative and intelligent it really is? Because if the source knowledge for the AI is almost identical, isn't this all not really that impressive?"
We need to see what Will Smith eating spaghetti looks like with this new AI
Scary stuff.
"lol actors, models and all useless jobs will be replaced"
Did you realize something funny about his hands at 8:11
But let's say that viewers dont care if something is actually real or not then who would care if its Marques telling his point of view or just some AI generated host with a complete made-up opinion. Hopefully we would always care about other humans and what is human made or not
"end of youtube creators, soon we'll have AI generated travel vlogs to places that do not exist by people who do no exist (or at least in this third dimension)"
"09:20 you need to look at their hands? 
doesn't the face of that grandma absolutely terrify you?"
It's not that big of a deal. Deepfakes are WAY more concerning.
"Putting public applications aside, super-realistic AI generated video will also let individuals indulge their worst impulses in private. Can you hold someone accountable for all the sick stuff AI will allow an individual to create privately, or share in private groups? It's very troubling how this can be used to foster mental illness. And even if people know it's AI, it still stimulates the brain and creates impressions and memories that can influence emotion and behavior."
This is going to be freaking awesome. So many new content are going to be created. Some industries will take a major hit on this unfortunately. Yet jobs and careers will be created.

Wonder how many videoes and photos these models stole for their dataset.
"Imagining in the very near furture, everyone can use AI to create their own Hollywood blockbuster movie at home, just WOW."
"Yes, this is crazy. At 2:27 the lags of the woman rolling around! And the rhytm of her steps are really strange"
Just because it is visually stunning it still requires creativity and nuance to be believable‚Ä¶. without that it can become tedious and boring. The human brain still has the upper hand at least for now.
My first thought  was will do I need a drone anymore. 10:55
"Very good point at the end. I'll raise you one, Marques, AI will never be sentient or conscious because humans have no idea what that actually means or how it works. AI is a fantastic gimmick, somewhat useful now, and will replace most humans from content generation; and who controls what AI can and cannot generate (anyone hit the red violation warning on a gpt? Yeah)will control, well, everything. So long, and thanks for all the fish."
I would like to see the most similar training data
"This is a ""pre 1st of April 2024"" comment"
Shook! but expected!
"Well, now I'm even more anticipated for those AI tools to be shut down than I was back then. Thanks, AI media generators. üôÑ"
Is anyone else just praying Will Smith will release an actual video of himself eating spaghetti and claim it was generated by Sora as a troll and but we‚Äôll never ever really know
"My only positive hope is that it gets so impossible to trust anything online, that people go back to caring more about real life"
I very rarely comment on YouTube (Maybe 4 times in 6 years). But these vids made by AI are so good that there scary
we're so hosed. this is soooooooooooooo much further ahead than I thought it would be.
"We‚Äôre watching the world change once again right infront our eyes, crazy lol"
"That wolf pup clip is hilarious. ""What if the theory of spontaneous generation was real?"""
Your point at the end about AI not generating any content it isn't trained on is what I think about with this stuff. If creators stop creating we don't get anything NEW.
Never in my life would've thought that creative would be the first thing AI takes down. Wild.
"Waiting to hear ""What's a video"" from marquesüòÖ"
"It's scary, plain and simple. Jobs, News, Pictures, Videos etc. Things are just getting to a point where it's just scary"
The beginning of cyberdyne systems then Skynet then.......I'll be back!!!!
Just think how many videos we've seen in the past 15 years that were made with AI without us knowing...
This is so amazing
"Its just like the Fire of Prometheus. Its too much for us maybe.. SPECIALLY for those intending on using for the bad things, in times of War, political crisis and **addictions**... Thank God I dont use any social media anymore except for Youtube and Whatsapp"
"They need to have all of the videos encoded with something identifying it as AI, similar to how cameras encode the geolocation into image files. If it is uploaded to any website it automatically has an AI label below it due to that encoding. That makes the most sense to me. It would still have flaws for people to get around it, but for the most part it would be extremely beneficial."
Old news
extremely useful for b-roll but also i'm sure it's super resource intensive
Finally can watch a proper ending to the show merlin
"Gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight."
"Hey, Marques! I really appreciate your takes on almost all topics and like how you try to find pros and cons. However i think you are missing the biggest threat here which is information veridicity. People will be subject to false information campaigns and will be manipulated. This has to be regulated in some way, with strict rules or encryptions related to watermarks. People will not play fair with this technology in their hands"
What gave away the woman: HER LEGS.
Do a taylor swift AI video

Man! I got so paranoid I was thinking what if your video is AI generated and was checking your hands if there is something off with them üòÖ
Cant wait to see how awsome game dev might  be when AI  really hits
"When it gets to a capability of 2 hours, we can make our own movies. ""a madmax movie with dinosaurs"", ""a romantic drama happening in the year 1700 old west"", ""a documentary about coffee and culture around the world"" ""a kids movie about the importance of empathy"""
0:32 her legs switched sides lol
We're going to get hyper personalised AI generated ads.
I actually liked wolf pups:D Smooth and cool. Can`t do it in regular videos :D
"Will Smith eating spaghetti needs to become the benchmark for all AI video, so we can watch how it progresses!"
"Okay. Somebody going to be like ‚ÄúMan, I can‚Äôt find a normal job because AI has taken over all the jobs, it‚Äôs hard to get hired these days, but at least I can focus on selling my creativity, whaaat?? Now AI is taking over my independent creative jobs???‚Äù. This is kinda worrying, but I‚Äôll try to remain optimistic in these weird times."
"4:33 A ""young man"", sitting in the clouds reading a book.


 Glad to see, the AI, put ""US"", in the clouds, with a book!!! 

Hallauyah for that young man."
"are there copyright concerns and legislation to protect artists and creators should be drafted and/or considered? Absolutely. 


However, we have all this uproar about ""changing the world"" and the dangers and concerns. 

These do exist, but this is the same cries and concerns always raised whenever there is a leap in technology. No one recall the uproar about very realistic and hard to catch Photoshops of 10-15 years ago? People being fooled by clips taken from video games and spliced into recorded footage? 

The main concern everyone seems to have is the lack of people being able to discern correctly that what they are perceiving is real or not. Which I believe not the fault of technology, but the fault of people as a whole losing touch with their critical thinking or discerning of their space. 

As much as it's dramatic to wail and lament about how much we can ""trust"" what is being created, and this is the stuff of dystopian sci-fi, having worked in IT and the IT industry on an enterprise level for 25 years, I've kept tabs on stuff like this. The rise and well of the outcry remains the same. There will always be the sky is falling types and we've seen it recycled over the centuries. 

Humans are so very quick to jump to the negative of such technology and while this may seem really advanced and amazing and almost reality-defying at the end of the day its another human making ""AI"" with code, and the code acting in its best possible capacity to predict what we tell it to do. 

There is no sentience, no intelligence, its still 1's and 0's in complex code being driven by powerful hardware, also human made. 

While the use of this technology can clearly be abused, we also held Photoshop, early AI chatbots, automated phone menus, and people who were very creative with Adobe Premiere and Vegas Studio with similar fear and terror. Automation is also another fear, held by those who were replaced with machines in textile mills. 

I get it. Fear of something a lot of people don't understand always drives views and clicks. When you have people who can barely recognize a malicious email and compromise their own identity to scammers by the millions on a daily basis, something like this seems like absolute magic. 

When you peel away the concepts it's the same old story. Something advances, people scared, concerns are dealt with through laws/regulation/settled in courts, people have to adapt to new ways they may be scammed out of their money or identity, and lamenting about how this will ""steal jobs"" when we've had literally centuries of ""job stealing"" progress constantly happening and it's been handled the best we know how. 

That however, isn't exciting for engagement.  Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon ""zOMG look at this shocking new tech!"" and everyone is scared and mystified because they barely know how a microwave works let along AI. 

Perhaps also the concept that we simply keep pushing artificial boundaries and get wow'd by how much it looks/acts/resembles ""us"" the closer we get to feeling oh so not special in the universe, and perhaps we are simply a very powerful simulation catching up to its own self-awareness."
"0:43 Personally, I find it disappointing that you worry about the Sora AI situation because, and I want to emphasize on it: it is capable of doing YOUR job. So what about the ChatGPT/Dall.E/Midjourney and the rest of them situation? Is this ""First they came"" by Martin Niem√∂ller?"
"I think this great, the future could be a lot more interesting with movies and tv shows. Any person with a creative mind could Crete some wild stories or even videos games with just going back and forth with an Ai until it‚Äôs the way they want. I‚Äôd totally dive into creating movies and stuff."
9:36 has the uncanny feel of a David Lynch movie
"Anyone else think that MKBHD is looking a bit AI generated? such a weird feeling, I feel like he's so much in the future that it could litteraly be an ai video of him, watch next week he'll be like ""so last weeks video was all generated by AI"""
actually the main giveaway on the first video was the nonsense Japanese text
"Facebook & Twitter helped to swing both the 2016 US election and the UK Brexit vote. Sora will do much, much more. We're in awfully big trouble ‚Äì the regulation and laws are way behind the tech..."
No. I will only believe after watching the new Will Smith spaghetti meal version!
My favorite AI video is Dwyne Johnson eating rocks.
Oh snap yeah dis OD! üòÆ i can see this possibly taking over  especially if it become more detailed and accurate on what you type
"If they launch the open source to the public, its game over for the media industry"
"The power of deep fakes, they've had this capabilities since last year. It definitely wasn't based simply off of text though. The textures on the main subject are a dead give away. I've been studying deep fake images off and on since 2020. It's either the textures, shadings or the movement seem to not match parts of the background. The potential of these to create fake news is the biggest threat this poses. Think of the timing of all of this too when it comes to how close to an election, plus the online censorship businesses that are getting really entangled with facebook, etc right around an election year. Just food for thought & a reminder to be weary, I would study this stuff so you have an artist's eye. That way you can spot these & deep fake type works. Still really cool overall that we've came this far, however I don't trust a proven corrupt gov/big businesses, etc with stuff like this. üòÇ‚òØÔ∏èü§ü‚òÆÔ∏èü§ô"
"I think we need continuity for ""Will Smith Eating Spaghetti"" (WSES) video so that we can critique how far we have advanced.  WSES v 2.1, 3.2, etc."
This is really scary
The copyright battles are going to get very interesting as every non creative person uses AI to make something
"the future is bleak.  I'm excited, but I'm not a fan of fakeness.  And every day tech brings us more in-tune with fakeness"
"Personally, I'd be perfectly happy if I was out for a walk and dozens of wolf pups starting appearing from the folds of space and time like that! üê∫"
Fun fact: this isn't Marques you're watching. The real one is still in bed giving prompts to the AI.
2:25 the feet literally swapped legs lol
"Shutterstock: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna be fine. This is fine.‚Äù
Blockbuster: ‚ÄúFirst time, huh?‚Äù"
Year ago I've made a comment that we will be able to make whole movies based on a few sentences with AI. I didn't know it would develop that fast.
Now you get why Artists hate ai.
AS if this world was not corrupt enough...do we really need more crap meant to fool people....
"There were always an abundance of videographers and filmmakers but not creatives. As he said, no AI came close to being creative yet..."
Those people can‚Äôt be imaginary! They definitely exist
no WAY
I hate ‚Äúthe future‚Äù
Even AI doesn‚Äôt know what to do with it‚Äôs hands üòÇ
The disappointment of learning that beach castle in the drone shot doesn't exist.  It will push us to only want to exist in the digital.
"We have already seen text based AI able to come up with things humans have never created (ex: thousands of new materials), nothing to suggest the same wouldn't be true with video."
"I'm afraid that, as stock footage, and probably other similar kinds of use cases, like genre images, newspaper illustrations, children's books illustrations etc, get cheaper to produce with AI, we will have to get use to a subpar representation of the actual thing. We will learn to accept weird hand movement, people walking sideways across streets etc, because to fix that last 5-10% would take an extra effort from a graphic designer that isn't in the budget. The result is this scary and sad uncanny valley simulacrum that removes us from reality even more."
Her legs switch place at 2:25
AI is the Future of almost Everything. Just wait till Tesla's Optimus and Figure's Humanoid Bot start getting AI upgrades. You need to adapt to the technology or get wrecked!
"Oh wow! I mean this is scary once you figured out the flaws, and try notice them, and how jump-scary they look. So close to perfection, the uncanny valley seems to be hellish deep!"
it's crazy I don't even know if you real damn LOL technology go a long way that is crazy to see real people that really not alive or not real I don't know synthetic life form
"The interesting thing is all of this is only possible because of the vast amounts of video data we've collected and labelled over years. If there's little to incentive for people to record videos anymore, it'll be interesting to see how ai models evolve over time, especially in keeping up with things people have never recorded before. For eg. The 50mm cinematic shot was only possible because people have recorded footage with a 50mm, and the model has trained on it."
NOW Generate Will Smith eating Spaghetti...
That spaghetti scares me..
is it really you in video?
Smells like the end of OF to me üë∫
"this isn't nearly the leap you are saying it is the clips are Much less complex as trying to eat spaghetti.  PLUS, there have already been full ai mock commercials and mock film previews made that were not bad.  PLUS, how many tries did it take to get this? It's a short video and you would be able to tell in seconds if it was going to be passable or not, so the 150th video of a set of 500 being good enough to use isn't any progress.  O and the puppies physics being ""incredible"" is a pretty big exaggeration since it looks like it's being played in reverse most of the time and the weird bending like the spaghetti video is present.  Also, even as short as the clips are, it's a pretty big insult to say it will fool people when Every Single One of them feels off; it's not that people are fooled, it just isn't something that matters in most context.  They ALL feel off and these are the hand picked best of the best by people working to sell the quality.
 There are a million youtubers overreacting and dramatizing non-issues, I don't need any more cluttering up my feed."
"I'm truly scared about this.  I don't know what ""real proof"" is going to mean anymore.  I don't know what one can possibly trust for news. I don't think it is hyperbole to say that we are about to see the end of the current civilization, as something drastic is about to break and collapse when we can no longer trust *anything* we see/hear/read."
Ok.. um.. as a full time YouTuber as well. This scares me..
"2:26
the legs just swapped"
"The only way to protect livelihoods at this point is to make this technology insanely expensive to use, but then it just become a rush for the cheapest human. Not the future we envisaged."
"Amazing how ai knows what Big Sur looks like without any drone photographers being ripped off.... right? it was ai... we swear. It's SOOOOO amazing, it just knew what Big Sur looked like. Wow!"
Imagine companies using this to make commercials..... lol
this is the worst it'll ever be...because things will definitely get worse üòÄ(i guess i should be more explicit with what my adjectives are referring to...this vs things)
"I feel like ""this is the worst these videos will look from now on"" is a good way to think about it but it can deceive how much progress is actually being done. As you said, these are hand-picked examples. It is very clear that these videos have limited framing (in the sense that they replicate professional video framing). And that's very much unlike what you can do with images. We can already make images from prompts, so a video superimposing those images over already existing types of videos isn't as big of a revolution. It is also not clear how easy would be to make the same jump into ""different framings"". It may take years to polish for all we know.

I'm guessing that the model is not widely available because it will completely break in the same way early DALL-E did when faced with unexpected framing."
"they do this seeking for profit, no matter what the consequences are. We must fight the capital logic. This should be used in our favor, and not scare us."
I don‚Äôt think is calculating physics nor ray tracing shadows and highlights since is not a 3D model. Based on Sora own technical report most of the magic is from trained data and scale. Specially for video blending which is insane to me as a content creator.
"AI generated 2001 odyssey remake wows audiences....
as AI creates time travel to make its movie a reality."
its just so uncool. there's nothing to enjoy
"1984  Terminator  said this all would happen. So just remember, you can unplug a computer ... for now :O"
"Yeah these videos are impressive, but none of them are Will Smith, nor are they eating spaghetti /j"
I thought it was an AI who was talking in this video.
"So in the not so distant future when these are so ""real""..... At what point does simulation theory need to be taken seriously."
"The more AI footage there is (and as a result, less IRL footage being produced), the more the AI will feed itself its own footage. It's basically going to inbreed at some point and look weirder and weirder."
"Graphic designer , photographer, video graphers , 3d artist, SFX designer and game designer are gonna be out of a job soon real soon"
People had the same concerns when photoshop came out so I‚Äôm not too worried about it. I think we will develop ways to verify the legitimacy of videos.
Any tools for generating videos from other videos? Like I film myself spitting bars at home and make it a full music video in a garage with AI?
"um, it still can't do Will Smith eating spaghetti. Also, so bad at doing hands/fingers. I have to have people wear mittens. You are right, it is getting better. And when it does, millions of jobs will be lost."
the guy in the cloud reminded me of the eddie murphy and michael jackson music video for Whatzupwitu
"I say that there will be an Oscar in 2030 that goes to the ""best AI generated film"". No matter whether voluntarily or involuntarily. And the winner will come from a small country wherever just come A laptop with the Internet is available.

Users will be uploaded similar to YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify Films to fiktive ""you share films"", which others can see again. Far from Hollywood. Simply this will create beautiful AI films and documentary that will have a quality like cinema films."
"RIP actors 
-Feb 2024"
Onlyfans will be bankrupt with this tech and their girls as well.
Still not Will eating spaghetti ü§∑üèº
*The space ship looks like a bad Hollywood movie from early 2000's.*
*The Done shot just looks like a video game fully fake looking*
fakin hate it.
yea soon we cant differentiate AI generated video from organic video we shoot
*Why would I think Asian plastic woman sliding on ice is real???*
"We're so fucked up.
Videos won't be able to be used as evidences in a court anymore.
People can create deep fakes of whoever they want doing whatever they want without any consent and we will never be able to tell if they're real or not.
We're so fucked up."
Why not show an improve version of Will Smith eating spaghetti if it's been a year and if it really improves?
At this point the only way you can recognice AI video is by it's very high quality üíÄ
"*So incredible and fake*  
*Jurassic park is over 30 years old and is light years way above this stylist bull crap*
*Everyone except Biden could not spot this*
*People gravitate to real not fake crap*

DYSTOPIAN FUTURE. LESSSSGGOOOOOOOOO
"If you're afraid of it, learn how to do it really quick"
It's crazy. Welcome to the world of B-rolls
How do we even know that YOU are real Marques?
AI made porn??
Videos like this make me confident that we've successfully reached and passed through the singularity in the future.
Sora is going to kill the stock footage market
AI Blows
"You would need some AI to detect ages! ""how old do you think she is? 60?"" You really have no clue about ages. She's more like 80 but AI-style a bit strange styled."
"Wow, really cool & scary at the same time. What's on my mind is how specific a result can you get with Sora? All the AI i've tried so far is very hit and miss, and almost impossible to get the exact result that commercial applications require, let alone the imperfections. It feels like AI is built by coders and linguists, rather than artist and film makers. Most Ai is entirely based on text prompt, which is holding it back, because the written word is too open to interpretation. What's needed to make this technology practical is the ability to input your own models, visual references and sketches in order to stylise and coerce the Ai into more specific results. When that happens it will be a game changer especially for artists who are more capable of harnessing this technology for their own work."
*The new A.I or Smart Software video is fully recognizable fake - so fake!*
The video of the older guy with the hat and beard is just scary good.
"Then what's point in making animated movies 
If everyone can make them with this 
It's going to kill the movie industry in next 15 years"
So this Ai thing is going to eat up all the animators' jobs ü•≤
No longer a need for actors making millions i guess
"I can tell if a video or picture is AI, unless it's something super simple with the proper lighting, etc. I use Keyshot for my job, and can make things indistinguishable for the most part. But I can also tell if a pic or vid is mirrored or not, such as when people use selfie mode to take pics or video, without telltale signs, like logos or words. I still haven't figured out how I can do that."
"OpenAI needs to be shutdown, yesterday!"
